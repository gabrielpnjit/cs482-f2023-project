00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
A chance of storms this weekend could bring much  

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,520
needed relief from the heat  to Phoenix-area residents.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,780
And Ukrainian forces say they have  liberated a key village in southern Ukraine.

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,220
Good morning, I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,900
Excessive heat is smothering about  180 million people in the U.S.,  

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,020
from the southwest to the northeast. It could  reach 113 degrees today in Phoenix. Tom Frieders,  

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,380
of the National Weather Service, says  the city is setting heat records:

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,920
"That continues with temperatures  continuing to be forecast to be  

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,740
above 110 into the first half  of the weekend. We do have, uh,  

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,420
increased risk of thunderstorms as we progress  through the weekend into early next week."

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,140
Those storms could lower the  Phoenix temperature below 110  

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,540
degrees for the first time in about a month.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,820
President Biden is poised to sign an executive  order today that changes part of the U.S. military  

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,580
justice system. The prosecution of serious  military crimes will now be transferred to  

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,400
independent military attorneys. That includes the  handling of sexual assault cases. The prosecution  

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,320
decisions will be taken away from victims'  commanders. The White House says the changes  

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,180
are part of a bipartisan military justice  reform effort to better protect victims.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,080
The 114th National Convention of the NAACP  opens today in Boston. For member station WGPH,  

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
Paris Alston reports about  10,000 people will attend:

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,360
"Boston last hosted the NAACP convention  in 1982. National board member and regional  

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,600
administrator Michael Curry says this year's theme  — "thriving together" — is about tackling issues,  

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,100
such as voter suppression and affirmative  action while celebrating by culture:

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,080
'We will have thousands of people who will  experience Boston, so I'm excited excited  

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,720
to have them immerse themselves in the history  of this city, and we have business to do here.'

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,020
"Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of  

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,640
State Hillary Clinton and rapper Meek Mill  are scheduled to speak at the convention.

"For NPR News, I'm Paris Alston, in Boston."

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,020
Ukraine says it has liberated a key village in the  south as its forces continue a counteroffensive to  

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,080
push Russian forces out of Ukrainian land.  NPR's Joanna Kakissis has more from Kyiv:

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,360
"Ukrainian soldiers who liberated the village of  Staromaiors'ke hold the Ukrainian flag and say  

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,960
'Glory to Ukraine.' President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  posted the video to his social media account with  

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,740
the message 'Our South. Our guys!' Staromaiors'ke  is north of the occupied port city of Berdyans'k,  

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,500
on the Sea of Azov. The capture of this village  brings Ukraine closer to one of its main  

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,680
counteroffensive goals: to reach the Azov Sea and  cut off Russia's land route to occupied Crimea.  

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,080
That would make it very difficult for Russia  to resupply its troops. But Russia has heavily  

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,480
fortified positions in the south, and Ukrainian  officials say they don't expect quick progress.
