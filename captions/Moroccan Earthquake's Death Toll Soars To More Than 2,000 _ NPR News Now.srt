00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,720
from NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,940
The death toll in Morocco has soared to  more than 2,100 people following Friday's  

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,040
devastating earthquake. NPR's Lauren Frayer is in  Marrakesh, just north of the quake's epicenter:

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,460
"The biggest thing you notice is people  sleeping out doors — lots of people,  

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,500
even if their home survived Friday's initial  quake, the aftershocks keep hitting, and so  

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,140
you see people just running out of buildings all  of the time and many are too scared to re-enter  

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,520
at all, and so every inch of green space, like  highway medians, are covered with sleeping bags."

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,400
NPR's Lauren Frayer in Marrakesh, Morocco.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,700
It's been 22 years since Al-Qaeda terrorists  hijacked four planes and crashed them in the  

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,080
eastern U.S. President Biden is returning  from Asia. He'll commemorate the day by  

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,600
giving a speech in Anchorage. First Lady Jill  Biden will lay a wreath at the Pentagon. Vice  

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,340

Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, will attend  the remembrance in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,880
For member station WITF, Rachel  McDevitt reports the hijackers  

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,600
who crashed in Pennsylvania were  the only ones to miss their target:

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,740
"Recordings from the flight illustrate  how the 40 passengers and crew members  

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,980
tried to take back control of the  plane, which was likely headed toward  

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,940
the U.S. Capitol building. It crashed in a  former strip mine in western Pennsylvania,  

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,160
killing all on board. The remembrance ceremony  in Shanksville includes a reading of the names  

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,660
of the victims along with a bell-ringing that  will coincide with the exact time of the crash,  

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,900
10:03 a.m. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who survived  the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, will offer a  

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,760
moment of reflection. The day's ceremonies wrap  up with a public wreath-laying at the memorial.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,280
The impeachment trial of Texas's suspended  attorney general is entering its second week.  

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,500
Ken Paxton faces 20 charges, and Texas  state senators will decide his fate.  

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,320
The Texas Newsroom's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán  reports Paxton has influenced national policy:

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,660
"Ken Paxton rose to prominence in Texas, but as  the state's attorney general, he's made a name for  

29
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,920
himself on a national level: He's challenged  the Biden administration on immigration,  

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,660
federal spending and abortion, and he's  used former President Trump's legacy to do  

31
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,240
it — according to the Dallas Morning News, of 20  policy challenges Paxton launched against Biden,  

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,360
17 were filed in front of Trump-appointed judges.  Many of these lawsuits have successfully stalled  

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,120
the implementation of Biden's policies. Paxton  has been suspended as attorney general since May.  

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,140
If he's convicted by the Texas Senate,  Paxton would be removed from office.

Officials with agribusiness corporation  Archer-Daniels-Midland say there's been  

37
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,900
an explosion at one of its plants in Decatur,  

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,060
Illinois — that's less than 200 miles  south of Chicago. Several workers have  

39
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,840
been hurt and hospitalized. There's  no word on the cause of the blast.
