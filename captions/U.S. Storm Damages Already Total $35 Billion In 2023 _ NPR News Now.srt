00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,520
Storms in the U.S. are becoming more costly,  

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,540
having caused more than $35 billion  in damage already this year.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,040
And it's been 75 years since President  Truman desegregated the military.

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,780
Good morning, I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,440
More than 180 million people in the U.S. are under  excessive heat warnings or heat advisories. Many  

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,660
states have soaring temperatures and heat  indexes in the triple digits or close to it,  

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,200
such as in southern Maine. There are  excessive heat warnings in the southwest,  

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,900
but also in parts of Kansas, Nebraska,  Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,940
Storms in the U.S. have caused at  least $35 billion worth of damage  

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,300
so far this year. NPR's Rebecca Hersher tells us  

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,380
that's according to a report from the  German insurance company Munich Re:

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,540
"Storms have caused significant damage across  the central and southern U.S. this year. The  

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,120
costliest single event happened in Texas in  June, when hailstones more than four inches wide  

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,460
destroyed cars and damaged homes. Losses in  the tens of billions of dollars from such  

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,400
storms used to be rare, the authors point out,  but are now a regular occurrence. One reason  

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,540
is that people are moving to places that are  prone to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.  

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,360
The storms themselves may also be getting worse  — scientists are still working to understand the  

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,280
potential connection between severe thunderstorms  and climate change, but climate models suggest  

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,080
a warmer atmosphere supports powerful  thunderstorms that can spawn tornadoes.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,400
The Justice Department is asking a federal  judge to order Texas to remove a floating  

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,800
barrier in the Rio Grande. Texas Gov.  Greg Abbott ordered the buoys placed to  

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,120
stop migrants from crossing. Texas  Public Radio's Dan Katz has more:

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,120
"The area around Eagle Pass, where  the buoys have been installed,  

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,780
is a hot spot for border crossings and  an already dangerous part of the Rio  

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,720
Grande to cross — there have been 89 deaths  and 249 water rescues in the area since 2018,  

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,760
according to an affidavit from the U.S. Border  Patrol Chief. The Justice Department is asking  

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,220
for an injunction to require Texas to remove the  buoys within 10 days and to block the state from  

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,900
installing any more river barriers without prior  approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,180
The buoys are Abbott's latest escalation of his  controversial Operation Lone Star border security  

31
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,280
program that's testing the legal limits of a  state's ability to enforce immigration policy.

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,040
75 years ago this week, President Harry Truman  signed an executive order desegregating the  

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,140
U.S. military. Defense Secretary Lloyd  Austin, a retired four-star Army general,  

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,560
is the first Black American to hold the top  Pentagon job. Today, he praised Truman's action:

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,500
"That landmark order demanded equality  of treatment and opportunity for all  

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:01,320
persons in the armed forces without regard  to race, color, religion or national origin."

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,820
Austin is visiting the nation of Papua New  Guinea. The U.S. is trying to strengthen  

39
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,900
relationships with Pacific island  nations to counter China's influence.
