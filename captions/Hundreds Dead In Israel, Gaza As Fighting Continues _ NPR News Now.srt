Iran claims to have had no involvement in  Hamas' attack on Israel over the weekend.

House will make their pitch to  Republicans tonight in a forum.

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,560
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,360
Israel says it has regained control of areas  of southern Israel that were attacked by Hamas  

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,160
militants. The Israeli military says it  has found hundreds and hundreds of bodies  

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,880
of Hamas militants who died fighting inside  of Israel — that's a sign of the size of the  

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,000
attack that was launched Saturday morning.  Israeli officials say at least 900 Israelis  

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,680
have been killed in the attack. Israel has been  heavily bombing Gaza. Palestinian officials say  

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,280
at least 700 Palestinians have been killed and  say about a third of them are women and children.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,880
Iran's Supreme Leader says the Islamic  Republic had no involvement in the Hamas  

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,440
attack. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports Ayatollah  Ali Khamenei did voice praise for what he  

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,640
called "irreparable" military and  intelligence defeat for Israel:

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,520
"In a televised address — his first since the  attack — Ayatollah Khamenei said Tehran was not  

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,680
involved. He did, however, hail the operation,  saying, 'we kiss the hands of those who planned  

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,640
the attack on the Zionist regime.' The Iranian  mission to the United Nations made a similar  

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,560
comment, saying Tehran firmly stands behind  the aspirations of the Palestinian people  

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,240
but refuted claims that it had a role in the  operation. Western and mid-east intelligence  

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,600
officials said Iran had provided training, money  and other assistance to Palestinian militants.

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,560
The White House says that, later today,  President Biden will speak about the  

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,320
situation in Israel. The administration  says at least 11 Americans have been  

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,960
killed in the attack. There have been many  demonstrations in the U.S. in support of  

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:59,840
Israel. That includes a prayer gathering held by  Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, New York, last night.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,720
There were rallies in support of Palestinians,  

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,520
as well. In New York, police separated  opposing groups using metal barricades.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,360
House Republicans are trying to elect a new  Speaker after Kevin McCarthy was removed  

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,600
from the job last week. NPR's Susan Davis  reports the two declared candidates will  

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,640
make their pitch to Republicans tonight in a  forum that's being held behind closed doors:

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,240
Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary  Chairman Jim Jordan are the only two declared  

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,240
candidates in the race. Neither lawmaker is  close to the near-unanimous level of support  

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,320
needed for Republicans to elect a new Speaker  on the House floor. And while the ousted Kevin  

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,240
McCarthy initially ruled out trying to reclaim  the gavel, he indicated in a press conference  

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,960
this week that he would if he could get the  votes. One of McCarthy's leading detractors,  

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Florida's Matt Gates, said on social media  that it was time for Republicans to 'move  

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,520
forward without McCarthy.' Republicans plan to  hold a secret ballot election on Wednesday and  

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,880
they could move to the House floor for a public  vote depending on the outcome of that election.
