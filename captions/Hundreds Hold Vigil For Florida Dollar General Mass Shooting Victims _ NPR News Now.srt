Hundreds gathered to hold a  vigil Sunday for the victims

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,680
of a mass shooting in Florida over the weekend.

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,160
And crews are working to contain  wildfires in multiple Louisiana parishes.

Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston, with  NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,920
The victims of the mass shooting  in Jacksonville, Florida,  

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,440
were remembered during a vigil yesterday.  Will Brown, of member station WJCT, reports  

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,880
a white gunman opened fire at a Dollar General  store on Saturday killing three Black people:

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,440
"Hundreds gathered under oak trees in an  oft-forgotten neighborhood Sunday to remember  

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,760
Angela Carr, AJ Laguerre and Jerrald Gallion. The  three were killed in an act of racial violence on  

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,440
Saturday afternoon in a Dollar General store  in Jacksonville's Grand Park neighborhood. The  

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,280
Reverend John Guns, of St. Paul Missionary  Baptist Church, knew Gallion for years:

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:03,720
'And I wept in church today like a baby  because my heart is tired. We are exhausted.'

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,200
"The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office says the  shooter, 21-year-old Orange Park resident  

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,280
Ryan Christopher Palmeter, obtained the  weapons used in the racist rampage legally.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,120
"For NPR News, I'm Will Brown,  in Jacksonville, Florida."

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,480
Emergency crews are working to  contain a series of wildfires  

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,280
burning in multiple parishes across  Louisiana. The blaze broke out near  

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,240
the Texas border nearly a week ago.  Aubri Juhasz, of member station WWNO,  

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,880
reports the fire has burned an estimated 60,000  acres and destroyed more than 20 structures:

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,000
"Multiple communities in and around Beauregard  Parish are under mandatory evacuation orders  

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,120
as firefighters chase flames that keep changing  direction. Sheriff Mark Herford says the parish  

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,680
has the resources it needs to keep fighting the  fire, but he doesn't yet see the end in sight:

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,760
'I don't really see us being able to to completely  

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,280
have this situation in hand until  we get some good, long rain.'

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,840
"The fire is just one of many burning  in the area and across the state.  

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,080
Louisiana's unusual number of fires  this year — more than 400 this month  

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,320
alone — have been caused by severe  drought and record-breaking heat.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,960
"For NPR news I'm Aubri Juhasz, in New Orleans."

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,680
Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo is  taking part in a series of meetings in  

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,800
China this week. The talks in Beijing  and Shanghai come as trade relations  

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,520
between the U.S. and China have hit historic  lows. Raimondo says she's looking forward to  

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,760
having constructive discussions on  areas for potential cooperation:

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,160
"It's a complicated relationship. It's  a challenging relationship. We will,  

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,640
of course, disagree on certain issues,  

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,720
but I believe that we can make progress  if we are direct, open and practical."

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,120
Raimondo says the economic relationship  between the U.S. and China is one of the  

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,520
most significant in the world, with the two  nations sharing more than $700 billion of trade.
