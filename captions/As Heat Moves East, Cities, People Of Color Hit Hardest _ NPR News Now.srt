A convicted Michigan school's hooter's  sentencing hearing will resume tomorrow.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,820
And an aid group says a New Hampshire nurse  and her child have been kidnapped in Haiti.

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,020
Good morning, I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,020
The heat wave is concentrating on the central  U.S. today. Heat indexes will be well into the  

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,760
triple digits from Wichita to New Orleans.  Health officials are warning people to do  

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,120
all they can to stay cool. Activist Sabrina Pacha  is with the group Healthy Air & Water Colorado.  

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,980
She says that's harder in communities  of color, which often have fewer trees:

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,760
"In Denver, we have a neighborhood that  is 88% residents of color and just 3%  

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,200
of their neighborhood has tree cover, in  comparison to another part of the city,  

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,680
where just 15% of residents are of color  and they have upwards of 17% of tree cover."

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,200
Problems with heat are amplified in cities —  they're subject to something called the urban  

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,320
heat island effect. Fewer trees and more asphalt  make it tougher for urban areas to cool off.

13
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,460
A hearing resumes tomorrow to  determine whether a convicted  

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,320
Michigan school shooter will get life in  prison without parole. Lawyers for Ethan  

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,000
Crumbley say he was so young at the time  of the Oxford High School shooting in 2021  

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,600
that he can be rehabilitated. From member  station WDET, Quinn Klinefelter has more:

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,520
"Prosecutors described how then-15-year-old  Ethan Crumbley took a handgun bought for  

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,300
him by his parents, calmly killed four  students and shot seven other people,  

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,520
then waited to see the pain he'd inflicted.  They say that demands a life sentence without  

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,680
the chance for parole. But the defense counters  that 15-year-old brains are not fully developed,  

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,660
and Crumbley never received any mental health  care. An expert on prison rehabilitation,  

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,120
Dr. Kenneth Romanowski, said juveniles convicted  of even the most heinous crimes can reform:

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,140
'Honestly, I think everybody has the  potential to change, and I think Mr.  

24
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,220
Crumbley would be no exception to that rule,  but I think he has to make that choice.'

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,820
"Defense attorneys say crumbly himself  might also also take the stand.

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,480
"For NPR News, I'm Quinn Klinefelter, in Detroit."

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,820
A relief group in Haiti says a nurse from New  Hampshire and her child have been kidnapped  

28
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,340
in Haiti. NPR's Joe Hernandez reports  that, last week, the State Department  

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,500
urged Americans to leave Haiti because of  rising gang violence, crime and disease:

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,840
"El Roi Haiti says on its website that Alix  Dorsainvil and her child were kidnapped from  

31
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,880
the aid group's campus outside Port-au-Prince  on Thursday. Dorsainvil is a nurse with the  

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,920
organization, as well as the wife of its  founder. In a statement. El Roi Haiti said,  

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,900
'Alex is a deeply compassionate and loving  person who considers Haiti her home and the  

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,980
Haitian people her friends and family.' A  spokesperson for the U.S. State Department  

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,800
says it has no higher priority than the safety  and security of U.S. citizens overseas and that  

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,840
it's in contact with Haitian authorities. Unrest  in the Caribbean nation has worsened recently,  

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,160
with a rise in kidnappings and other  violence committed by armed gangs.
