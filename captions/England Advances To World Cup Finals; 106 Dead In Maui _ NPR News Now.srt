At least 106 people are dead after  the devastating wildfires in Maui.

00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,640
And federal officials are easing  some water restrictions along  

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,800
the Colorado River after a wet winter.

Good morning. I'm Jeanine Herbst, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,640
Survivors of the deadly wildfires in Maui  that destroyed the city of Lahaina are  

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
finding communications are still difficult,  with intermittent power and unreliable cell  

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,600
service. At least 106 people are dead.  Many residents say they are worried about  

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,920
scammers and major developers coming in  to buy up the land as they try to rebuild  

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,080
their lives. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green says  he will come down hard on anyone who does:

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,700
"If someone behaves in a predatory fashion towards  one of the people that are suffering right now,  

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,960
who have lost their loved ones or  lost their home, lost their rental,  

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,080
and they try to buy land out from under them,  you can be sure I will not be allowing anyone  

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,360
to build or rezone or do anything of that sort  if they've taken advantage of anyone here."

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,300
President Biden says he will visit the area soon.

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,140
On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority  Leader Chuck Schumer is marking  

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,160
the first anniversary of President  Biden's major legislative achievement,  

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,600
also known as the Inflation Reduction  Act. NPR's Deirdre Walsh has more:

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,980
"Schumer acknowledged that it will take a while  for the impact of the climate and health care  

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,400
bill to sink in with voters, but he says, 'The  best is yet to come.' The Senate majority leader  

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,320
argues that talking about the economic benefits  of the law, which Democrats passed on their own,  

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,700
will show a major contrast between  the two parties in the 2024 election:

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,440
'And I think the contrast  

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,880
between the Republicans and us is glaring —  we are investing, they are investigating.'

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,840
"Schumer says that what he calls the  largest climate action bill in history  

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,880
will lower costs and expand the middle class  by creating new jobs in the energy sector,  

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,960
but Republicans say Americans  are still paying higher prices,  

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,980
and that inflation will hurt  Democrats next fall at the ballot box.

00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,500
Federal officials are easing cutbacks on some  users of the Colorado River after a wet winter  

30
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,080
gave the nation's largest reservoirs a boost.  For member station KUNC, Alex Hager has more:

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,540
"Arizona and Nevada will still face some cutbacks  to their water supplies in 2024, but they'll be  

32
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,460
less steep than this year's — that's according  to the Bureau of Reclamation — but pressure is  

33
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,560
still on policy makers to reduce water demand  over the long term. Brenda Burman directs  

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,280
the Central Arizona Project, which brings  Colorado River water to the Phoenix area:

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
'All of us who rely on the river, who  rely on our amazing infrastructure,  

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,140
have to be able to come to the table  and show how they can live with us.'

37
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,860
"Human-caused climate change is shrinking  the amount of water in the river,  

38
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,260
and the seven states that use it are scrambling to  

39
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,860
find ways to cut back on demand from  cities and farms across the arid West.
