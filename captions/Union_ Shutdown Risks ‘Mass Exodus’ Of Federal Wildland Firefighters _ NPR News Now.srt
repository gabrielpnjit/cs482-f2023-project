00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,240
Hollywood's writers and major studios have reached  

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,420
a tentative deal that could end  a nearly five-month-long strike.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,760
And thousands of federal wildland firefighters  are bracing for pay cuts later this week.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,200
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,940
There's a tentative agreement between  striking writers and Hollywood studios.  

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,440
If approved by striking writers, it  could end a five-month-long walkout.  

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,920
Details of the proposed agreement  have not yet been disclosed,  

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,560
but writer's guild member and strike captain  Bill Wolkoff says he is eager to see the terms:

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,720
"I know they would not, uh, have,  uh, told us a tentative deal was  

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,400
reached — and told us that picketing  is suspended — if it wasn't exemplary."

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,300
CEOs from four Hollywood studios  joined negotiators at the table.  

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,680
They're facing thorny issues — from  higher residual payments when shows  

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,340
go into reruns and protections  against artificial intelligence.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,820
Thousands of federal wildland firefighters are  bracing for major pay cuts in less than a week  

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,040
unless Congress intervenes. NPR's Kirk  Siegler reports an expected government  

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,260
shutdown before then is stoking fears  of mass resignations within the force:

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,480
"About 19,000 Federal wildland firefighters could  see their paychecks slashed starting this coming  

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,820
Sunday unless Congress passes pending legislation  that would give them a permanent increase. Prior  

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,860
to the fall of 2021, some rookie firefighters  on the frontlines of major wildfires have been  

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,440
making $15 an hour. That year, U.S. Forest  Service and other federal agency firefighters  

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,720
got temporary pay raises of up to $20,000 from  the infrastructure law but now those are set  

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,640
to expire and, in the meantime, efforts to give  wildland firefighters. A permanent pay raise have  

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,040
stalled in a divided Congress. The union that  represents them as warning of a "mass exodus"  

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,900
from the workforce just as we're going into the  typical peak of California's wildfire season.

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,980
President Biden is welcoming several leaders  from Pacific Islands to the White House  

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,600
today for a summit. The White House says  the forum will focus on climate issues,  

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,180
economic growth and strengthening security. The  Biden administration is trying to fortify U.S.  

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,340
relations with Pacific Island nations  to counter China's growing influence.

30
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,260
U.S. border officials have reopened a  railroad bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas.  

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,620
Texas Public Radio's Jerry Clayton reports, last  week, thousands of migrants crossed into the city:

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,020
"The international railway bridge was closed last  Wednesday after a state of emergency declaration  

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,360
from the city's mayor. Vehicular traffic remains  closed on the international bridge. At one point  

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,520
last week, around 8,600 migrants crossed  into the U.S. and Eagle Pass in a 24-hour  

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,740
period. The surge has also overwhelmed migrant  resource centers, such as the one in San Antonio,  

36
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,200
which has been averaging around 750 migrants  a day seeking assistance. The U.S. Department  

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,080
of Defense sent an additional 800 personnel to  the border to handle the increase in crossings  

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,540
by last Friday. The number of migrants crossing  an Eagle Pass had dropped by around two-thirds.

39
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,460
