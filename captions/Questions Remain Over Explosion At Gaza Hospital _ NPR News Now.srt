00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,080
Questions continue to swirl around a deadly  explosion at a Gaza hospital this week.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,200
And after two days and two ballots,  

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan still doesn't  have the votes to become Speaker of the House.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,320
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,440
President Biden is said to make a national  address tonight from the Oval Office. He's  

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,800
expected to propose a significant aid package  to support Israel and its war against Hamas and  

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,880
further aid to Ukraine as it fights Russia's  invasion. This comes as the president is also  

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,080
pledging $100 million in humanitarian aid  to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,120
The president and the U.S. intelligence  community do not believe, at this point,  

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,240
Israel was responsible for a deadly explosion  at a Gaza hospital this week. The blast killed  

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,920
hundreds of people. But as NPR's Greg Myre  reports, there's still a great deal of  

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,560
uncertainty surrounding the blast, and Israelis  and Palestinians continue to blame each other:

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,840
There are photos, videos and eyewitness  accounts of the huge explosion at the  

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,720
al-Ahli Arab Hospital, but there's not yet  clarity on who's responsible. The blast dug  

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
a relatively small hole in the hospital's  parking lot, and the hospital did not suffer  

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
structural damage — that suggests a smaller  weapon was used. Israel says it was a rocket  

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,480
from a Palestinian faction that was directed  at Israel but misfired. Palestinians insist the  

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,520
blast was part of Israel's ongoing bombing  campaign. President Biden says he believes  

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,920
the Israeli version, though U.S. officials say  they're still gathering additional information.

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,800

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,560
After two days and two ballots, Ohio  Republican Congressman Jim Jordan still  

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,120
doesn't have the votes to be elected Speaker  of the House. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports his  

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,600
opponents say he'll lose more support  if he pushes for a third vote today:

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,640
Republican resistance to Jordan's bid  for Speaker appears to be hardening  

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,680
or even growing. It's been 16 days since  California Rep. Kevin McCarthy was ousted,  

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,520
and the House is still frozen — it can't  function until a Speaker is elected.  

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,920
Calls to give the temporary Speaker,  Patrick McHenry of North Carolina,  

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,320
powers to allow votes on bills are growing.  McHenry says, for now, his role is limited:

29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,560
My role here is to be determined, but I've  constructed that as narrowly as the rules  

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,080
say I should, and we can't transact  business until we elect a Speaker.

31
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,120
Jordan's GOP opponents warn tactics of  his allies to pressure them for votes are  

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,280
dangerous. Two members who voted against  Jordan say they received death threats.

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,200

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,600
The National Hurricane Center  is watching Hurricane Norma,  

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,080
off Mexico's Pacific Coast. Hurricane specialist  John Cangialosi says Norma is powerful:

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,040
It's the Category 3 — maximum winds are near  120 mph — and it's to the south of the southern  

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,720
portion of the Baja California Peninsula — it's  about 450 miles south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,120
Meanwhile, hurricane forecasters say Tropical  

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Storm Tammy is in the Atlantic Ocean  and could soon turn into a hurricane.

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,120
