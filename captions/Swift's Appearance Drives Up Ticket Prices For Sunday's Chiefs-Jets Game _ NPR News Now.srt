00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,280
Former President Donald Trump's civil business  fraud trial gets underway today in New York.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,400
And more than 75,000 health care workers at Kaiser  

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,880
Permanente are preparing to  go on strike later this week.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,320
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,200
Former President Donald Trump says he will  be at the state courthouse today in New York  

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,160
City. He faces civil fraud charges that  threaten some of his most iconic assets,  

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,600
including Trump Tower. NPR's Brian Mann reports:

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,840
"Donald Trump and his associates, including  his two sons, are accused of systematically  

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,680
overvaluing their properties by more than $2  billion in order to secure financing and make  

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,320
deals. In one case, New York Attorney General  Leticia James says they inflated the square  

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,400
footage of a building by 300%. Last week, state  judge Arthur Engoron issued a summary judgment,  

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,240
finding Trump did violate accounting rules  Engoron described Trump's valuations of his  

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,560
properties in financial statements as fantasy.  Trump calls these claims a sham and says they're  

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,880
meant to cripple his president presidential  campaign. If the fraud charges hold up in court,  

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,120
Trump could lose control of many of his prize  assets and be forced to pay a $250 million fine.  

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,960
This civil trial is unrelated to four criminal  trials Trump faces in state and federal courts.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,800
"Brian Mann, NPR News, New York."

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,320
The federal government did not shut down over  the weekend after Congress passed a short-term  

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,840
spending bill. The legislation includes billions  of dollars for U.S. emergency disaster help,  

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,920
but not a cent for aid to Ukraine.  When the bill got to the Senate,  

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet held it up  

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,400
for a time until he got a commitment from  leadership to debate funding for Ukraine:

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,320
"This is one of those times when we can't  afford to have an institutional failure.  

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,400
I think this is beyond politics. You know, if  we turn our back on Ukraine, um, we know from  

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,600
President Zelenskyy that Europe will turn its  back on Ukraine and they will lose the war."

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,840
He spoke to NPR's weekend All Things Considered.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,120
Meanwhile, Florida Republican Congressman  Matt Gaetz is seeking to oust House  

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,320
Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Gaetz says  that McCarthy broke his promises  

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,920
to hardline House Republicans by working  with Democrats to pass the spending bill.

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,360
More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente health  care workers across the United States are  

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,640
preparing to go on strike for three days.  The walkout would start this Wednesday.  

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,120
As NPR's Danielle Kaye reports their  union contract expired over the weekend:

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,360
"These Kaiser workers, whose contract expired  on Saturday, include nurses, lab technicians,  

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
pharmacists and many others. They're  represented by a coalition of 12 unions  

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,160
that's bargaining with Kaiser, one of  the biggest health care providers in  

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,080
the U.S. The union say Kaiser hasn't offered  adequate solutions to end a staffing crisis,  

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,320
which they say is negatively affecting patient  care and employees' well-being. Kaiser and the  

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,000
unions say they're willing to keep bargaining to  reach a deal on a new contract, but if there's  

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
no agreement by Wednesday morning, tens of  thousands of workers will walk off the job.  

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,040
Kaiser says hospitals and emergency departments  would stay open in the event of a strike.

"Danielle Kaye, NPR News."

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,160
Taylor Swift showed up at last  night's NFL game between the  

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,720
Kansas City Chiefs and the New York  Jets. NPR's Emma Bowman reports that  

44
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,640
Swift's star power is giving the NFL a  big opportunity to cash in on her status:

45
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,280
"The pop star returned to MetLife Stadium  in New Jersey, but this time, she wasn't the  

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,680
headliner — despite all the jokes on NBC's  pregame show, "Football Night in America":

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,280
'Ladies and gentlemen, "The Eras Tour"  continues — Taylor Swift is in the building.'

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,960
"Swift was there to support  Chief's tight end Travis Kelce,  

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,640
but the Swifties still showed up. After the  news dropped that the pop star would be there,  

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,960
the price for last-minute cheap seats rose  by 10% on the ticket marketplace Gametime.  

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Swift arrived at the stadium with a gaggle of  A-list celebs, but the talk was all Taylor:

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,440
'I'm not going to make a Travis Kelce-Taylor  

53
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,840
Swift joke. I think we know  those jokes "All Too Well." '

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,520
"Swift's last showing at a Chief's game  drove up sales of Kelce's jersey by 400%.
