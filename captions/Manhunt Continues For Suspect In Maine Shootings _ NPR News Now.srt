00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,360
The search continues for the suspect  in Wednesday's mass shootings in Maine.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,560
And Israeli forces conducted  another raid on northern Gaza  

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,000
overnight as U.N. officials say fuel  shortages are crippling relief efforts.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,120
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,160
The search has continued through the night  in Lewiston, Maine, for Army reservist Robert  

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,360
Card. He's considered the prime suspect in  Wednesday's mass shootings. NPR's Brian Mann  

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,120
reports there have been no confirmed sightings  of him and the community remains in lockdown:

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,040
A small army of police descended on one  farmhouse last night outside Lewiston,  

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,720
but no arrests were made, and Card remains  on the run. He has been charged with murder  

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,320
following Wednesday's shooting at a  bowling alley and nearby bar that left  

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,800
18 people dead. This week's violence  caused Maine Congressman Jared Golden,  

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,200
a Democrat, to reverse his opposition to  banning military-style assault weapons:

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,320
To the people of Lewiston, I ask  for forgiveness and support as I  

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
seek to put an end to these terrible shootings.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,000
Legislation that would reinstate  the ban on military-style assault  

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
rifles has been stalled in Congress for years.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
Brian Mann, NPR News, Lewiston, Maine.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,560
Israel says it conducted another brief raid into  northern Gaza overnight. The Israeli military says  

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,880
it targeted Hamas militants in response  to Hamas attacks nearly three weeks ago.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,160
The Israeli blockade of Gaza  continues the United Nations  

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,080
says its relief aid to Palestinians  is collapsing. U.N. official Philippe  

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,240
Lazzarini says relief workers need  fuel badly and that's been cut off:

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,520
A few days ago, I warned that we will  not be able to continue our humanitarian  

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:48,240
operation if we do not get the fuel supply. My  warning still stands. Over the last few days,  

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,560
UNRWA has drastically limited its consumption  of fuel, but this came at a cost — our team  

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,520
had to make tough decision that  no humanitarian workers should do.

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,200
Gaza health officials now say more than  7,300 Palestinians have been killed in  

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Israeli military attacks. Israel says  Hamas killed more than 1,400 people,  

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,360
mostly Israelis, when militants  attacked on October 7th.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,840
Embattled Congressman George Santos will be back  in federal court today. From member station WNYC,  

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,760
Brigid Bergin reports the New York  Republican is facing 10 new fraud charges:

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,920
He's accused of conspiring with his former  campaign treasurer to file false reports with  

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,680
the FEC that inflated his fundraising numbers,  including a fictitious half-million dollar loan  

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,880
Santos claimed to make to his own campaign  when he only had $8,000 in his bank account,  

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,360
according to prosecutors. He's also accused of  stealing his donors' credit card information and  

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
attempting to make thousands in charges.  Some he masked as campaign donations and  

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,280
others he funneled to his personal bank  account. Santos pleaded not guilty to 13  

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,440
earlier charges at an arraignment in May,  and he continues to say he will not resign.
