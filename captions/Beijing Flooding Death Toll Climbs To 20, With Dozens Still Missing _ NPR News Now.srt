00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,900
Former President Donald Trump has been  indicted over his alleged efforts to  

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,900
overturn the results of the  2020 presidential election.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,900
And at least 20 people are dead and dozens more  missing after days of heavy rain in Beijing.

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,340
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,200
Former President Donald Trump has been  indicted on four charges related to  

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,120
alleged efforts to overturn the 2020  election. NPR's Jaclyn Diaz has more:

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,580
"This indictment is the third criminal case  against Donald Trump and may be one of the most  

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:39,660
serious against the former president. This case  involves at least six co-conspirators and involves  

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,300
allegations Trump and his allies interfered in  a U.S. election in an attempt to cling to power.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,420
"Prosecutors also allege that Trump engaged with  officials in several states to spread lies that  

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,620
there was election fraud. Trump's co-conspirators  have not been named by prosecutors. He's expected  

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,360
at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C.,  for his first court appearance on Thursday.

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,940
"Jaclyn Diaz, NPR News."

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,040
Vice President Harris says she's rejected  an invitation by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis  

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
to join a roundtable discussion. It was  to focus on Florida's new Black history  

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,060
curriculum. One instruction tells Florida  middle school students that some enslaved  

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,320
Black people gained skills that could  sometimes be used for their personal  

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,360
benefit. Speaking in Orlando. Harris  lambasted that as "revisionist history":

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,860
"There is no roundtable, no lecture,  no invitation we will accept to  

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:48,240
debate an undeniable fact. There were  no redeeming qualities of slavery."

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,860
Florida Gov. DeSantis accuses the  Biden administration of misinforming  

22
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,740
people on the subject and disparaging his state.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,240
The National Weather Service says the  dangerous heat wave persists from the  

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,420
Southwest into the southern Plains  today and down to the Gulf Coast.  

25
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,700
Heat indexes could reach 110 degrees from  eastern Texas to southern Mississippi.

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,460
At least 20 people are dead and dozens of others  are missing in flooding in China's capital,  

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,100
Beijing. As NPR's Julia Simon reports,  climate change can make rain events worse:

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,500
"China is experiencing record-breaking  heat this summer — northwest China saw  

29
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,640
temperatures of 126 degrees. Scientists from  the World Weather Attribution initiative say  

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,700
this summer's heat wave is virtually impossible  without human-caused climate change — a hotter  

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,400
atmosphere can hold more moisture, so  rainstorms can be more intense. Global  

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,620
warming primarily comes from humans burning  fossil fuels. If humans seriously reduce  

33
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,260
the use of fossil fuels, scientists say the  world can avoid more devastating scenarios.

34
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,420
"Julia Simon, NPR News."

35
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,400
Meanwhile, a new typhoon is lashing  southern Japan. There are reports  

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,820
from Japan that one person may  have been killed by the storm.  

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,980
This typhoon's current path could lead  it to hit eastern China later this week.
