Good morning. Today is Tuesday,  September 5th. I'm Korva Coleman,

00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,960
from NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,880
The former leader of the far-right group the  Proud Boys will be sentenced today in federal  

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,440
court in Washington. Enrique Tarrio  is facing decades in prison for his  

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,080
role in the January 6th attack at the U.S.  Capitol. NPR's Jaclyn Diaz says Tarrio is  

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,480
among five members of his group convicted  of seditious conspiracy or other crimes:

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,720
"Prosecutors say Tarrio and his lieutenants  saw themselves as foot soldiers of the right.  

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,040
He was convicted, along with four other members  of the Proud Boys, back in May. On January 6th,  

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,560
2021, Tarrio wasn't at the Capitol; rather,  he was at a hotel room outside of Washington,  

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,720
D.C. Prosecutors say, from this position,  Tarrio urged his members to take control  

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,960
of the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors  are seeking 33 years for Tarrio,  

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,600
but the judge is likely to give him less —  some of Tarrio's co-defendants have received  

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,040
lengthy prison sentences but shorter  than what the government had requested.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,120
"Jaclyn Diaz, NPR News."

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,160
The Texas State Senate will open  an impeachment trial today against  

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,600
Attorney General Ken Paxton. He is accused  of several counts of corruption. Paxton  

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,840
says he is innocent and derides the  case as a politically motivated sham.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,200
Leaders of the United Auto Workers say they  are pressuring the Big Three automakers to  

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,920
agree to huge changes in their contracts  — UAW workers are seeking a 46% pay raise,  

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,120
a 32-hour workweek with full pay and the return  

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,680
of traditional pensions. UAW President  Shan Fain says the union is determined:

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,000
"If we don't get our share of social and  economic justice, I can guarantee you one thing:  

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,480
Come September 14th, we're going to take  action to get it by any means necessary."

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,880
Officials with General Motors, Ford and  Stellantis say the union's demands are  

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,760
unreasonable. They cite international competition  as the industry changes to electric vehicles.

26
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,560
China's top leader, Xi Jinping, will not be  among the world leaders who are attending  

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,240
the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi,  India, this coming weekend. Instead,  

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,760
China is sending its premier. Beijing has  not given an explanation for this snub,  

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,160
but NPR's Emily Fang reports  why Xi will be absent:

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,000
"China's Foreign Ministry said Premier Li Qiang,  widely seen as a Xi ally, will attend the summit.  

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,760
Xi Jinping has not said why he won't attend  the meeting, which will be hosted by India's  

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,960
Narendra Modi. Xi does have more than enough  to do at home, however — critical sectors of  

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,760
the Chinese economy have been tanking, namely real  estate and construction, and that's dragged down  

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,760
economic growth and worsened business sentiment  in the country. And China-India relations have  

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,560
gone from bad to worse — soldiers from the two  countries had a fatal brawl near a contested  

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,360
border in 2020, and since then, China and India  have expelled all of each other's journalists.
