U.S. Secretary of State Anthony  Blinken has arrived in Israel as  

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,800
death tolls among Israelis and  Palestinians continue to rise.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,880
And tensions are also high on  the Israeli-Lebanese border.

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,400
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,040
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has  arrived in Israel for immediate talks  

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,920
with Israeli leaders. He's reiterating U.S.  support for Israel following the Hamas attack  

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,800
on the country. Israeli President Isaac Herzog  is demanding other nations also condemn Hamas:

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,560
"I call upon the international  community, unequivocally:  

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,760
Make clear and loud condemnation of Hamas, just as  you condemned ISIS — they are one and the same."

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,880
Israeli officials now say Hamas killed at  least 1,300 Israelis. Hamas also continues  

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,640
to hold scores of people hostage. Israel is  heavily bombing Gaza. Palestinian authorities  

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,920
say at least 1,200 Palestinians have been  killed in Gaza by Israeli air strikes.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,160
Meanwhile, tensions remain high on the  Israeli-Lebanese border after exchanges  

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,600
of rocket and artillery fire this week.  Many Lebanese fear their country could be  

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,720
dragged into the conflict between Hamas  and Israel. Jawad Rizkallah has more:

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,640
"Hezbollah attacked a military position near the  Israeli town of Avivim with anti-tank rockets and  

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,160
then fired missiles at Israeli soldiers near the  Palestinian-Israeli village of Arab al-Aramshe 

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,320
this week. The Israeli army responded with  artillery and drone strikes against the  

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,440
Lebanese village of Al-Dhayra, where at  least one house was destroyed. They also  

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,720
hit at least two other villages. Hezbollah  has also called upon the Arab and Islamic  

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,560
world to condemn the American decision to  deploy the U.S. Navy's largest aircraft  

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,360
carrier to the eastern Mediterranean.  In a statement, the Lebanese militant  

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,720
group said the action would not deter from  potential further confrontation with Israel.

The federal fraud case continues  against cryptocurrency mogul Sam  

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,840
Bankman-Freid. The prosecution's  star witness, Caroline Ellison,  

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,560
accused him of masterminding a scheme to steal  billions of dollars. NPR's David Gura has more:

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,200
"Caroline Ellison was the CEO of the  hedge fund Sam Bankman-Freid founded,  

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,560
a member of his crypto-empire's inner circle,  and she Bankman-Freid's ex-girlfriend. In her  

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,320
second day of testimony, Ellison detailed how  she manipulated balance sheets, allegedly at  

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,600
Bankman-Freid's direction, to disguise billions  of dollars Alameda took from customers of FTX  

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,840
without their knowledge. She also recounted  what happened in late 2022 amid a downturn in  

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,160
the crypto market and as the relationship  between Alameda and FTX was scrutinized.  

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,240
As Ellison described the collapse of Alameda  and FTX, she started to cry. It was, she said,  

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,280
the worst week of her life. Bankman-Freid's  defense attorney will cross-examine her today.

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,600
The House is still in recess as Republicans  try to move forward their choice to be  

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Speaker. Congressman Steve Scalise won  a GOP leadership election yesterday,  

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,760
but he doesn't have enough Republican  votes yet to win the Speakership.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,840
Separately, a group of House Republicans  is seeking to expel fellow GOP Congressman  

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,320
George Santos. He denies charges of corruption.
