00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,320
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is  visiting several Arab states today to  

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,400
discuss the current conflict  between Israel and Hamas.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,480
And Steve Scalis is dropping out  of the race to be House Speaker.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,920
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,840
Israel is telling Palestinians in northern Gaza to  leave immediately and go to the southern part of  

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,440
the enclave. They've been given 24 hours to  do so. It's feared that an Israeli military  

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,600
ground assault will soon begin. Hamas leaders  have told Palestinians not to go anywhere.  

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,560
U.N. officials and other human rights groups are  urgently warning that a million Palestinians are  

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,560
under the Israeli warning, and it's impossible  to move that many people in so short a time.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,120
Separately, Hamas leaders are claiming  that Israeli airstrikes have killed 13  

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,920
Israeli and foreign hostages. The claim has not  

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,800
been confirmed. Hamas has abducted  scores of people out of Israel.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,200
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken  is making a swing through several  

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,160
Arab states today to discuss the  conflict. NPR's Michelle Kellerman  

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,320
reports he wants the leaders to  urge Hamas to free the hostages:

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,000
"Secretary Blinken started his day with  a closed-door meeting with Jordan's King  

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,920
Abdullah followed by talks with the Palestinian  Authority President, who has a residence in  

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,840
Amman. The State Department says Blinken  discussed the 'horrific' Hamas terrorist  

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,720
attacks on Israel and the efforts to secure  the release of all hostages and prevent the  

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,120
conflict from widening. That's a message he's  also bringing to Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia,  

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,920
the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. At that last  stop, Blinken will also discuss efforts to open up  

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,800
a humanitarian corridor out of Gaza, especially  for Palestinian Americans trapped there.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,600
"Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, Amman."

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,480
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin  arrived in Tel Aviv a few hours  

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,760
ago. He's meeting with Israeli leaders to  discuss U.S. security assistance to Israel.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,600
Republican Congressman Steve Scalise is  quitting the race to become the next Speaker  

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,400
of the House. NPR's Giles Snyder reports he  didn't have the votes from other Republicans:

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,120
"Congressman Scalise spoke  to reporters after emerging  

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,520
from a closed-door meeting with  his House Republican colleagues,  

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,440
saying he is withdrawing after they failed  to come together around his nomination:

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,840
'Clearly, not everybody is there, and there's  still schisms that have to get resolved.'

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,560
"The House has been without of Speaker  since the ouster of Kevin McCarthy,  

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,880
leaving the chamber unable to take action on  the government spending bills needed to avoid  

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,120
a shutdown in November and facing pressure  to support Israel in the war with Hamas.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
"Giles Snider, NPR News."

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,640
Philadelphia police say one officer has  been killed and another wounded after they  

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,320
tried to interrupt thieves breaking into  a car at the airport. Interim Philadelphia  

38
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,280
Police Commissioner John Stanford says  they're looking for the assailants:

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,920
"There are multiple suspects that were  involved in this situation, so, um,  

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,720
still trying to get some additional information  on those other individuals that were involved so  

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,560
we can get that information out  as quickly as we possibly can."

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,120
Philadelphia authorities say another  person was taken to the hospital,  

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
rather, hospital separately and died.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,480
