On Maui, the death toll has risen to at least 111.

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,140
And Texas is suing Planned Parenthood for  millions of dollars in Medicaid payments.

Good morning. I'm Jeanine Herbst from, NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,760
The death toll from the Maui fires has  risen to at least 111, with the number  

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,160
expected to grow in the coming days. As the  island undertakes the long road to recovery,  

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,840
leaders say it's important to also make  sure the economy stays healthy and,  

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,040
as NPR's Jason DeRose reports, that  means keeping tourist numbers up:

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,780
"When the fires broke out last week,  state and island officials immediately  

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,860
urged tourists not to come, but it's  since become clear that most of the  

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,780
damage — although severe — is contained  to the western part of Maui. More than  

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,000
half the island's residents have jobs in some  way related to the tourism industry. Christian  

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,820
Galapon’s aunt works as a housekeeper at a  Maui resort. She lost her home in the blaze:

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,420
'You know, people were asking her, like,  "Well, you just lost everything, like,  

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,890
why'd you clock into work?" And she was,  like, "I still need to make money." '

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,580
"Last year, close to 3 million tourists visited  the island and spent nearly $5.7 billion."

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,820
"Jason DeRose, NPR News, Maui."

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,500
Planned Parenthood is awaiting a  ruling in a major lawsuit. Texas  

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,080
Tech Public Media's Sarah Self-Walbrick  reports that the state of Texas is suing  

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,960
Planned Parenthood for millions  of dollars in Medicaid payments:

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,380
"Texas tried to block Planned Parenthood from  getting Medicaid funds in 2015. That didn't happen  

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:45,660
until 2021. Now, Planned Parenthood estimates it  could have to pay more than a billion dollars. It  

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,500
could lead to more clinic closures in Texas. Susan  Manning is general counsel for Planned Parenthood:

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,700
'Many of the health care center patients  are women, people with low incomes and  

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,780
people from other communities who have  historically faced barriers to care.'

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,120
"Conservative judge Matthew Kaczmarek, who  has made several high-profile rulings in  

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,160
abortion-related cases, has not said  when he will decide in this case.

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,880
"I'm Sarah Self-Walbrick, in Lubbock."

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,240
In California, retailers are struggling as  several flash mobs rush into luxury stores and  

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,640
rob them. One of the latest was last weekend, at a  Nordstrom, when more than 30 masked people rushed  

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,580
into the store, broke display cases and made  offer with around $300,000 worth of merchandise.  

31
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,000
Governor Gavin Newsom provided additional funds  to establish a retail theft task force, and that,  

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,140
police say, led to the arrest of dozens of  people wanted in several thefts at different  

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,360
stores in a two-day operation in Bakersfield.  California Highway Patrol Chief Rodney Ellison:

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,440
"During these two days of operations, CSP  investigators arrested over 50 suspects  

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,780
for charges related to retail theft and  recovered nearly $60,000 in product."

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,340
Police say some of the theft rings  are being organized on social media.
