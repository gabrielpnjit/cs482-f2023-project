A former advisor to former President Donald Trump

00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,420
has been convicted on criminal  charges of contempt of congress.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,280
And record rainfalls swept across Hong Kong  and parts of southern China on Thursday night.

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,660
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:22,140
President Biden arrives in New Delhi in a few  hours to attend the Group of 20 summit. India  

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,840
holds the rotating G-20 presidency this year,  and India is looking to prove itself as a world  

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,360
leader. But Sushmita Pathak reports in New Delhi,  some of the preparations have drawn criticism:

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,040
"New Delhi has gotten a makeover in recent  weeks, with decorative lights and water  

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,860
fountains embellishing its streets. Posters about  the G-20 are on every corner. But as the city  

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,020
gears up to welcome world leaders, officials  have evicted slum dwellers and removed hawkers  

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,480
and beggars from the streets. Green sheets pitched  on wooden poles along key roads hide the homeless  

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,520
from view. This has prompted criticism from  opposition parties and civil society groups  

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,160
who say India wants to be a voice for the global  south but is hiding its own problems with poverty.  

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,980
The summit is also expected to inconvenience Delhi  residents — food delivery is barred in many parts,  

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,360
traffic is heavily restricted, and dozens  of trains and flights have been canceled.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,780
"For NPR News, I'm Sushmita Pathak, in Delhi."

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,240
Former Trump aide Peter Navarro has been convicted  on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress.  

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
He was charged with defying a subpoena from the  House select committee investigating the January  

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,820
6th insurrection. NPR's Dustin Jones reports  Navarro could spend up to two years behind bars:

20
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,660
"It took less than four hours for a  federal jury to issue a guilty verdict,  

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,800
after only hearing from three witnesses,  none of whom came from the defense.  

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,180
After the verdict was issued, Peter  Navarro said he would be exonerated:

23
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:59,880
'I am willing to go to prison to settle this issue  — I'm willing to do that, but I also know that the  

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,700
likelihood of me going to prison is relatively  small because we are right on this issue.'

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,600
"Navarro had tried to have the charges  dismissed, citing executive privilege,  

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,980
but a judge ruled against that argument  last week. He is the second former Trump  

27
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,340
aide to be convicted for failing to  cooperate with a congressional subpoena.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
"Dustin Jones, NPR News."

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,940
Flash floods caused by unprecedented rain and  downpours have caused widespread disruption in  

30
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,820
Hong Kong and in parts of southern China.  We have more from the BBC's Celia Hatton:

31
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,020
"Hong Kong recorded its highest rainfall since  records began — more than 15 centimeters in a  

32
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,220
single hour. Millions have been forced  to shelter in Hong Kong and the Chinese  

33
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,120
mainland's neighboring hub of Shenzhen. In Hong  Kong, roads were turned to rivers, metro stations  

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,940
and shopping malls have been flooded with water.  More than 80 people sought hospital treatment,  

35
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,280
and several needed to be pulled from their  cars. All schools have been closed and the  

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,240
authorities are urging employers to  allow their staff to remain at home."
