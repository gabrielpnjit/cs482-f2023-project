00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
The UAW is on strike against automakers Ford,  

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,480
GM and Stellantis after failing to  reach a contract agreement overnight.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,060
And lawmakers in Wisconsin have fired  the state's top elections official.

00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,000
Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston, with  NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,140
About 13,000 U.S. autoworkers are walking  the picket lines this morning just hours  

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,680
after contract negotiations broke down between the  

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,300
United Auto Workers union and  Detroit's Big Three carmakers.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,400
Drivers honking their horns in support of striking  workers at the Stellantis plant in Toledo,  

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,520
Ohio. Stellantis worker Leticia Hummer says  there's no telling how long the strike will last:

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,080
"As long as it takes for us to  get a fair, fair contract. I,  

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,360
I want to look out for my brothers and sisters."

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,080
Negotiations broke down between  the United Auto Workers Union  

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,020
and the three big car makers over  wage increases and other demands.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,940
The death toll from catastrophic  flooding in eastern Libya has surpassed  

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,000
11,000. That's according to the Associated  Press. Linda Fasulo reports the United Nations  

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,600
is asking countries for more than $70 million in  assistance to help those impacted by the floods:

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,340
"U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths  says the U.N. is on the ground in Libya,  

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,200
providing food and medical supplies, and  is deploying what he called a robust team  

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,660
to support the international response to the  disaster. He described the scale of devastation  

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,900
as 'shocking' and 'heartbreaking.' Meanwhile, the  director of the U.N. meteorological agency said  

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,660
most of the casualties could have been avoided  if Libya had an operating weather service that  

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,100
could have issued warnings and emergency  authorities able to carry out evacuations.  

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,800
Libya remains in political and military  stalemates, with two competing governments.

24

"For NPR News, I'm Linda Fasulo, in New York."

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,520
Lawmakers in Wisconsin voted to fire the  state's top elections official just months  

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,660
before the 2024 primary. Anya van Wagtendonk,  from Wisconsin Public Radio, reports the move  

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,080
sets up an unprecedented legal battle over who's  in charge of elections in the battleground state:

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,780
"Republicans, who control the state Senate,  moved to oust Meagan Wolfe. In response,  

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,420
Wisconsin's Democratic Attorney General, Josh  Kaul, filed suit. Kaul said the Legislature  

30
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,620
acted illegally in subjecting Wolfe to  a confirmation vote in the first place.  

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,960
He's asking a court to confirm that. And  Wolfe said she's continuing in the job:

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,540
'There is such important work ahead,  

33
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,940
and my hope is that we will quickly get  the clarity that we need from the courts.'

34
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,980
"The procedural wrangling comes after Wolfe  has faced years of criticism from supporters  

35
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,420
of former President Donald Trump. They've  accused her of undermining the 2020 election,  

36
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,620
which Joe Biden won in Wisconsin  by less than a percentage point.
