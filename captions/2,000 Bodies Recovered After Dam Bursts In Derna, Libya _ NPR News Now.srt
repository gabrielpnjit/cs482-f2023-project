The Senate continues to work on legislation  to regulate artificial intelligence.

00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,680
And the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention is  

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,040
urging everyone 6 months and up  to get the new COVID boosters.

Good morning. I'm Jeanine Herbst, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,940
In Libya, 2,000 bodies have been recovered  from the eastern port city of Derna after  

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,840
heavy rains caused dams to burst,  sending floodwaters into the town.  

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,940
Officials say entire neighborhoods were  washed away. NPR's Ruth Sherlock has more:

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,360
"With roads cut off, um, there's very, there was  very little help getting to Derna for the 30, the  

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,600
first 36 hours. Now there are responders in the  city. Faraj al-hasi, of the Libyan Red Crescent,  

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,660
he's in the organization's emergency response  room, and he told me they're being inundated  

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,940
with calls by people who are still stranded  in the storm debris or trapped under rubble,  

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,440
and they're also looking at how to cope with  all of those that have lost their homes."

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,660
NPR's Ruth Sherlock reporting.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,360
Libya is a country that's divided by two rival  

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,960
governments and has dealt with  more than a decade of conflict.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,540
The Senate's getting back to work on crafting  legislation that would regulate the use of AI.  

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,800
NPR's Windsor Johnston reports the first  of a series of forums will be held today,  

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,280
as lawmakers scramble to keep  up with the emerging technology:

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,920
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  says today's AI insight forum is the  

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
next step in the complicated process  of regulating artificial intelligence:

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,640
'It will affect just about every aspect of society  in major ways — both positive and negative — and  

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,120
on an issue this wide-ranging and important,  we must make every good faith effort to act.'

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,760
"Schumer says members of the Senate will be  seeking input from tech pioneers, including  

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,340
Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.  The forums, which will run through the fall,  

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,400
will also hear from academics, national  security experts and civil rights leaders.

The CDC says everyone age 6 months  or older should get an updated COVID  

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,820
vaccine this fall. NPR's Maria Godoy reports this  

29
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,140
guidance follows an FDA advisory group's  recommendations on the vaccine's rollout:

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,020
"In a statement, the CDC said that vaccinating  everyone from 6 months and up with updated shots  

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,080
will protect against potentially serious outcomes  from COVID illness this fall and winter. Updated  

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,800
COVID vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna  will be available later this week. In a separate  

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,240
statement, the Department of Health and Human  Services said that most Americans will still be  

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,940
able to get a COVID vaccine for free. For people  with health insurance, most plans will cover the  

35
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,940
COVID-19 vaccine at no cost. People who don't  have health insurance or who have health plans  

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,940
that do not cover the cost can get a free vaccine  from their local health centers and pharmacies.
