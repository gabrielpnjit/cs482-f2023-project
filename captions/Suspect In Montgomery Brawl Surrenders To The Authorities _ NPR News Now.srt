Good morning. I'm Nora Raum, with NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,440
In Montgomery, Alabama, one of three  suspects charged with misdemeanors  

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,060
following a riverfront brawl on Saturday that  went viral has surrendered to authorities.  

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,980
The others are expected to be in custody  soon. The city's mayor is confident the  

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,600
altercation won't affect tourism. Troy  Public Radio's Kyle Gassett reports:

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,140
"Videos of a Black co-captain of a riverboat being  beaten by and fighting with white passengers from  

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,900
a pontoon boat have been viewed millions of times.  Montgomery's first Black mayor, Stephen Reed,  

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,060
says he doesn't see long-term negative effects  from the attention the incident has received:

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,200
'People can separate, uh, you  know, a few bad apples, uh,  

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,040
carrying on from an entire community, and  so we expect that, but we also know that we  

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,900
have to continue to do things each and every  day for our citizens and our residents here.'

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,520
"Tourism is a major revenue generator for the  city, which has both civil rights landmarks  

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,180
and museums and monuments built  by the Equal Justice Initiative.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,500
Republicans proposed the threshold for  an amendment be approved be raised and  

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,880
that proponents meet stricter requirements  to place a proposed change on the ballot.  

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,320
The rejection means a referendum on the  November ballot to enshrine rights to an  

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,160
abortion in the Ohio Constitution will  need a majority of the vote to pass.

highlight investments in clean energy.  Member station KUNM's Alex Fordham reports:

"National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi  told reporters about Air Force One that,  

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,780
in New Mexico, people would get a chance to  see a 'manufacturing renaissance' brought  

27
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,140
about by the administration's actions,  including the Inflation Reduction Act.  

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,020
Zaidi mentioned a new plant manufacturing wind  towers in the city of Belén and the SunZia line,  

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,180
a transmission project set to deliver primarily  renewable energy from New Mexico to Arizona and  

30
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,040
California. New Mexico's state government is  working toward a statewide renewable energy  

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,380
standard of 50% by 2030, but in the last few  years, fossil fuel extraction has ramped up,  

32
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,280
and last year, it was the second-largest  crude oil producing state, after Texas.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,860
Attorney Jose Baez says his client is  being punished for being a celebrity:

37
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,480
"I have seen cases — vehicular homicide  and other cases where there's death — and  

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,700
the person still gets less than 10 years."

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,620
He says they'll appeal the sentence.

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,800
Hurricane Dora is passing well off the Hawaiian  Islands, but its winds have grounded firefighting
