1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,534
President Biden is in Israel

2
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:05,138
today on the heels of a deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,475
And House Republicans continue to try to find a way forward

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,678
after another failed vote for speaker yesterday.

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,347
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR News,

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,182
and here are today's top stories.

7
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,252
President Biden is in Israel where he's meeting first responders

8
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,255
deployed after Hamas militants stormed into the country.

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,991
He's also meeting family members of victims.

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,594
Biden got to Tel Aviv a few hours ago.

11
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,664
He's met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet,

12
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,667
where he again expressed his support for Israel:

13
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,737
We will continue to have Israel's back

14
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,307
as you work to defend your people.

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,944
We'll continue to work with you and partners across the region

16
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,181
to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians.

17
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,651
Biden's visit to Israel comes as the region convulses

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,821
following yesterday's explosion at a hospital in Gaza.

19
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,990
Hundreds of people were killed.

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,759
NPR's Jackie Northam reports from Jerusalem

21
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,895
there's concern the war between Israel

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,765
and the militant group Hamas could spread into a wider conflict:

23
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,436
President Biden arrived in Israel as images of rescue workers

24
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:13,973
sifting through the rubble at the hospital in Gaza flooded on to social media:

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,043
Footage of medical workers trying to save the wounded;

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,247
dozens of bodies wrapped in blankets and white sheets nearby.

27
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,583
The reaction to the blast was immediate:

28
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,351
Street protests in the region,

29
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,154
Arab leaders canceling a summit with Biden,

30
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,624
and increasing concern a broader war could erupt.

31
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,009
Palestinians blame the explosion on an Israeli airstrike,

32
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:37,831
one of many into Gaza throughout the day.

33
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:41,801
Israel blamed the armed Palestinian faction Islamic Jihad.

34
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,972
President Biden, in talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,

35
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:51,311
appeared to back that claim, which likely won't help ease tension in the region.

36
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,314
Jackie Northam, NPR News, Jerusalem.

37
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:58,118
The White House says although Biden won't meet face to face with Arab leaders

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,588
during his visit, he will talk to two of them by phone.

39
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,924
Biden is to hold a call with the leader of the Palestinian Authority

40
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,927
and Egypt's president on his flight home.

41
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,965
House Republicans will try again to find a path forward after their latest

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,569
nominee for speaker lost his bid for the gavel in a first round of votes.

43
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,872
NPR's Claudia Grisales reports

44
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,042
Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan is facing a long list of detractors

45
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,111
with little margin for error:

46
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,048
Jordan and his allies had hoped to quickly try a second time,

47
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,486
but postponed after it became clear many of his detractors are dug in.

48
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:38,393
He lost by 20 votes in the first round, and some Republicans predict

49
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,694
that could grow longer in a second ballot.

50
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,398
The Republican speaker nominee needs almost all members

51
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,768
in the conference to vote yes to become speaker.

52
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:53,940
However, many of Jordan's detractors are still angry at the process and tactics

53
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,244
deployed by Jordan and his allies to try to flip votes in his favor.

54
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,215
It's led to growing talk of Republicans expanding acting

55
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,853
Speaker Patrick McHenry's powers for a temporary period.
