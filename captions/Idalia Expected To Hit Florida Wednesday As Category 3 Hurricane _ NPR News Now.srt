Hurricane Idalia is making its  way toward Florida's Gulf Coast.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,780
And a 20-year-old Ugandan man could  face the death penalty after being  

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,320
charged with so-called "aggravated homosexuality."

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,260
Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston, with  NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,700
The Biden administration has released a list of  medications that will be subject to the first  

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,040
ever price negotiations by Medicare.  The list includes 10 prescriptions,  

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,460
including blood thinners Eliquis and Xarelto,  and the diabetes drug Jardiance. The provision  

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,580
that allows Medicare to negotiate the price of  prescription drugs for people over the age of 65  

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,700
was part of President Biden's signature Inflation  Reduction Act that he signed into law last year.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,280
Hurricane Idalia is gaining strength  as it heads toward the Gulf Coast of  

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,040
Florida. NPR's Greg Allen reports the storm  is expected to make landfall tomorrow as a  

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,420
category 3 hurricane with wind  speeds of 120 miles per hour:

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,380
"The National Hurricane Center says Idalia  is moving north through the Gulf of Mexico  

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,180
on a track that's likely to bring it ashore  Wednesday in Florida's Big Bend area. That's  

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,440
a relatively undeveloped part of the state,  but Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says people  

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,180
should be prepared for impacts along most of  the Gulf Coast, from Tampa Bay to Panama City:

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,800
'This thing comes in at category three, it's going  to knock over trees, it's going to knock over  

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,140
power lines, it's going to cause an interruption  in service, so just be prepared for that.'

19
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,340
"Idalia is also forecast to bring a storm  surge as high as 12 feet in some areas  

20
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,660
and flooding from heavy rains as it moves  through Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,300
"Greg Allen, NPR News, St. Petersburg."

22
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Former White House Chief of Staff  Mark Meadows testified in Atlanta  

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,820
yesterday as part of an effort to  move racketeering charges against  

24
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,560
him to federal court. Georgia Public  Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler has more:

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,860
"Meadows is one of 19 people,  including the former president,  

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,120
under indictment for allegedly violating  Georgia laws by taking various steps to  

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,740
overturn the 2020 election there. In a court  hearing seeking to move his charges to federal  

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,600
jurisdiction and ultimately seek to dismiss  them, Meadows defended actions like organizing  

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,400
a call between Trump and Georgia's Secretary  of State. He argued that, as Chief of Staff,  

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,920
those things were part of his job responsibilities  advising the president, but prosecutors alleged  

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Meadows engaged in political activity outside  of his role and violated state law in the  

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,100
process. The move comes as arraignments for  all 19 defendants is set for next Wednesday.

"For NPR News, I'm Stephen Fowler, in Atlanta."

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,160
A 20-year-old man in Uganda has been charged  for so-called "aggravated homosexuality."  

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,100
NPR's Emmanuel Akinwotu reports it's an  offense that carries the death penalty:

36
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,160
"We managed to get in touch  with his lawyer, Justine Ballia,  

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,400
and she said he's the first person to be charged  for 'aggravated homosexuality.' She told us he's  

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,860
being charged for having, 'sexual contact  with someone with a disability of the same  

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,240
sex.' We don't know what the disability  is or really much else about the case."
