00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,100
The head of Maui's embattled Emergency  Management Agency has resigned.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,080
And a new federal report says 2023  could be one of the hottest on record.

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,820
Good morning. I'm Jeanine Herbst, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,240
Maui's Emergency Management administrator has  resigned a day after defending his decision not  

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,280
to use the island's siren system during  the deadly wildfires. Herman Andaya says  

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,940
he doesn't regret his decision because  he says the sirens are mainly used for  

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,400
tsunamis. He says people would have headed to the  mountains, into the fire. Residents dispute that.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,780
Meanwhile, the burn zone in Lahaina  is toxic. Officials are worried about  

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,380
asbestos and lead because of the  age of the homes and businesses,  

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,960
along with other toxic chemicals in the ash  and debris. NPR's Gabriel Spitzer has more:

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,040
"The biggest danger comes from ingesting  or breathing in the toxic chemical,  

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,780
so that means that the really acute risks go  way down once the fire is out and the smoke is  

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,060
dissipated. But lots of the emissions start  out as airborne particles and smoke end up  

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,560
settling back down into ash and soot and they  cling to surfaces they run off into the water,  

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,240
and that means people could be exposed  over and over for a really long time."

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,980
NPR's Gabriel Spitzer.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,420
At least 111 people died. About  1,000 are listed as missing.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,320
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration says this year could  

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,220
be one of the hottest in recorded  history. NPR's Seyma Bayram has more:

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,120
"Last month marked the hottest July since 1850.  South America, Africa and Asia saw record warm  

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,300
temperatures. Arizona, New Mexico, Florida and  Maine also experienced their hottest July on  

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,320
record. Now, about 30% of the U.S. is experiencing  drought, says NOAA climatologist Karin Gleason:

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,000
'Drought conditions expanded or  intensified across much of the  

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,820
Deep South and parts of the Southwest, as well  as the Northwest and extreme Northern tier.'

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,800
"Scientists say most of the U.S. will continue  seeing above normal temperatures through November.

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,760
North Carolina's Democratic governor  will soon decide whether to veto  

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,480
sweeping elections legislation  approved this week by the state's  

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,240
Republican-dominated Legislature. From  member station WUNC, Rusty Jacobs has more:

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,520
"The GOP bill would eliminate a three-day grace  period for counting mail-in ballots postmarked  

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,680
by Election Day. Republicans say that would  boost voter confidence in Election Day results,  

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,420
but Democrats in the North Carolina  General Assembly note the grace period  

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,360
was established in 2009 through bipartisan  legislation and that claims of widespread  

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,120
voter fraud are baseless. State Rep. Robert  Reeves worries eliminating the grace period  

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,520
could result in otherwise valid votes getting  tossed due only to unreliable postal service:

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,880
'We are making it harder  for people to have a voice.'

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,880
"Gov. Roy Cooper is likely to veto the bill,  

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,720
but Republicans have the legislative  super-majority to override it.
