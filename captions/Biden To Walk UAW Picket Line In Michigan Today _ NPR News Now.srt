President Biden will walk a picket line with  members of the United Auto Workers today.

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,440
And later today, a hearing gets underway over  a doping scandal from the 2022 Winter Olympics.

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,640
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,220
This is Day 12 of the United Auto Workers' strike  against Detroit's Big Three automakers. President

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,320
Biden plans to be in Michigan today to join  a picket line in the Detroit suburbs. NPR's

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,860
Deepa Shivaram reports the president  was invited by the head of the UAW:

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,600
"President Biden, who often touts himself  as being the most pro-union president,  

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,460
says the United Auto Workers helped save the  automobile industry when it was crashing:

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,020
'And I think that, now that  the industry is roaring back,  

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,280
they should ... they should participate  in the, in the benefit of that.'

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,840
"Biden's visit comes the day before former  President Donald Trump comes to visit Detroit  

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,560
as well. The union endorsed Biden in 2020 but has  yet to endorse a candidate in the 2024 election.

A union representing thousands of  hospitality workers in Nevada is  

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,680
taking a strike vote today. The Culinary  and Bartenders Union is negotiating with  

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,780
the Las Vegas casinos and hotels for a  new contract. No walkout is imminent.

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,140
The House is scheduled to vote on  spending bills today. The government  

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,200
will partially shut down this weekend unless  Congress passes spending legislation. Some  

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,740
hardline House Republicans are  blocking their own party's bills.

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,560
Authorities in Hawaii have allowed the first set  of people to return to their burned out properties  

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
in the city of Lahaina. Most of the city on  the island of Maui was burned to the ground by  

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,473
wildfires in August. At least 97 people perished.  Resident Tawny Katayama lost her family home:

23
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:52,860
"Lahaina ... it looks like a war  zone, and we are grieving, and  

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,880
there are triggers everywhere,  and we're not ready for that."

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,000
The residents were offered protective equipment  to shield them from toxic dust — there's concern  

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,980
that the ash could contain dangerous  substances, such as asbestos or lead.

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,740
A three-day hearing gets underway today in  Switzerland. It's expected to finally settle  

28
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,640
a doping scandal that marred the 2022 Winter  Olympics in Beijing. NPR's Brian Mann reports,  

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,400
because of the controversy, some U.S. figure  skaters still have not received their medals:

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,200
"Russian star figure skater Kamila Valieva  was found to have tested positive for a banned  

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,700
substance, but she was still allowed to compete  in Beijing last year. Months of international  

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,680
legal wrangling followed, leading to this week's  final hearing before the Court of Arbitration for  

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,540
Sport. U.S. skater Vincent Zhou says he wanted  to be present for the hearing but was denied:

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,560
'That just adds another layer of  obscurity to, you know, you know,  

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,100
what really goes on behind closed doors —  what sorts of conversations are they having,  

36
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,980
you know, like, why don't  they want us to, to see?'

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,040
"Valieva faces a possible  multi-year suspension from  

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,040
figure skating. If she and her  Russian team are disqualified,  

39
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,260
U.S. team skaters will receive a gold medal. It's  not clear when a final ruling will be issued.
