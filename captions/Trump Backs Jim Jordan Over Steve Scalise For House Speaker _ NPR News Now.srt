00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,280
Two candidates are vying to be  the next Speaker of the House,  

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,440
and former President Donald  Trump is backing one of them.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,920
And thousands of health care workers  remain on strike against Kaiser Permanente.

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,680
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,000
It's still unclear who will be the next  Speaker of the House. Former President  

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,720
Donald Trump initially floated the idea of  temporarily filling the post himself. Now,  

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,040
he says he's backing Ohio Congressman  Jim Jordan. NPR's Windsor Johnston  

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,600
reports the other contender for the  speakership is Louisiana's Steve Scalise:

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,200
"Congressman Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise  are rushing to lock down the more centrist  

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,400
members of the conference ahead of a vote that's  expected to take place next Wednesday. Jordan,  

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,160
the chairman of the powerful House Judiciary  Committee and a fierce defender of Donald Trump,  

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,680
has pitched himself to his fellow Republicans as  someone who can unify the party, going forward.  

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,520
Majority Leader Scalise has argued that he has  the experience needed to unite the conference,  

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,440
having served as part of the House Republican  leadership team for the past 10 years. In order  

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,640
to become the next speaker, any candidate  will need a simple majority of the House  

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,840
members who are present and voting.  Historically, that number has been 218.

17

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,880
The co-founder of the failed  cryptocurrency exchange FTX has  

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,760
testified against accused crypto mogul Sam  Bankman-Fried. As NPR's David Gura reports,  

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,280
Gary Wong testified he committed  fraud at Bankman-Freid's direction:

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,080
"The U.S. government alleges Sam Bankman-Freid  defrauded FTX customers and investors and  

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,960
lenders to the now-defunct cryptocurrency-focused  hedge fund he co-founded called Alameda Research.  

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,720
On Thursday, jurors heard testimony from a  partner at the venture capital firm Paradigm,  

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,880
which invested hundreds of millions of dollars  in FTX. Last November, when the cryptocurrency  

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,920
exchange collapsed, Paradigm marked down  that investment to zero. Prosecutors began  

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,080
questioning Gary Wong, who started FDX with  Bankman-Freid and pleaded guilty to wire fraud,  

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,720
securities fraud and commodities fraud charges.  He's a cooperating witness who said in court  

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,240
he committed those crimes with Bankman-Freid  and others. Wong's testimony continues today.

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,400
About 75,000 unionized health care workers  for Kaiser Permanente remain on strike across  

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,760
the country. They're demanding better wages, and  they're calling on Kaiser to immediately address a  

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,640
significant staffing shortage in its facilities.  Caroline Lucas directs the coalition of Kaiser  

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,600
Permanente unions. She says Kaiser patients  also want new health care workers to be hired:

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,520
"We are having overwhelming support  from existing Kaiser patients,  

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,440
who have called, emailed, showed up  to our strike lines to tell us that  

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,120
they are overwhelmed and tired by the  Kaiser wait to get appointments today."

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,680
The strike against Kaiser  will end tomorrow morning.

rights for women in Iran's theocratic  government. Mohammadi is in prison.
