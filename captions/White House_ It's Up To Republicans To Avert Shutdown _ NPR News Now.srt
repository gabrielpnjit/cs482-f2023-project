00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,880
The White House chief of staff  tells NPR it's on Republicans  

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,240
to avert a looming government shutdown.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,600
And bans on gender-affirming  care for minors in Tennessee  

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,760
and Kentucky are being allowed to go into effect.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,000
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,600
The White House insists the government  should not shut down this weekend and  

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,120
that it would not if House Republicans did  their jobs, but as NPR's Asma Khalid reports,  

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,720
the Biden administration is  working on contingency plans:

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,800
"The Office of Management and Budget is  coordinating with federal agencies to ensure  

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,600
there's a plan in place if the government shuts  down on Sunday. The White House chief of staff,  

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,520
Jeff Zients, told NPR the president  expects Congress to do the "right thing":

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,600
'And if we get into the unfortunate situation  — which we should not — of the government  

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,960
shutting down, then the president will  communicate with the American people.'

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,760
"Zients noted a shutdown would have a big  impact: small business loans and FEMA recovery  

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,800
efforts would be stalled, active troops and air  traffic controllers would not get paychecks.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,360
"But the main message from this White House  is that there was a deal struck months ago to  

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,520
fund the government, and House Republicans  need to keep their end of the bargain."

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
"Asma Khalid, NPR News."

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,120
The United Auto Workers could increase  the number of automotive facilities  

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,600
they're striking today. The union has  said it wants to see more progress in  

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,320
contract talks with the Big Three U.S. automakers.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,040
Transgender children in Tennessee and  Kentucky will no longer be able to access  

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,280
gender-affirming care. A federal court has ruled  both states can enforce bans on their care while  

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,640
respective lawsuits go through the courts. From  member station WPLN, Marianna Bacallao has more:

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,040
"The ruling from the Sixth Circuit  is temporary as both states deal with  

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,600
legal challenges to laws preventing trans kids  from accessing treatment like hormone therapy  

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,360
and puberty blockers. And a similar ban being  considered in Ohio, also in the Sixth Circuit,  

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,240
now has a more clear path forward. That  worries plaintiff Samantha Williams,  

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,600
who had been looking into crossing state  borders to get care for her trans daughter:

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,000
'The two states where we were looking to  

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,960
go for care if the injunction wasn't  granted now have bills of their own.'

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,440
"The ruling puts the issue of gender-affirming  care one step closer to the Supreme Court,  

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,000
as courts have blocked similar banss  in other states from taking effect.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
"For NPR News, I'm Marianna  Bacallao, in Nashville."

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Officials in New York City say  they've arrested a drug suspect.  

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,800
They allege he carried about 30 pounds  of fentanyl in a rolling suitcase onto  

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,040
a city subway. Frank Tarantino is with  the Drug Enforcement Administration:

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,640
'It is the most reckless and most  irresponsible thing that traffickers  

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,160
could do, is move this poison on  the public transportation system."

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,440
Officers found more fentanyl in the  suspect's New York City apartment.  

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,480
This happened just blocks away from another  drug bust last week. A 1-year-old baby died  

42
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,440
after being exposed to the drug  in his apartment-based daycare.

43
