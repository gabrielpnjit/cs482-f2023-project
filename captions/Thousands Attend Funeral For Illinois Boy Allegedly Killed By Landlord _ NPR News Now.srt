00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,800
President Biden will meet in Israel and  Jordan tomorrow with those country's leaders.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,360
And the House may vote today on whether to elect  Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan as its next Speaker.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,040
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
President Biden leaves this afternoon  for a short trip to Israel and Jordan,  

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,080
arriving tomorrow. He'll meet in person  with leaders. NPR's Tamara Keith reports  

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,960
Biden wants to hear about Israel's  military strategy and its needs:

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,120
Normally, when a president visits a  war zone, it's done in secrecy — when  

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,200
Biden went to Ukraine earlier this year, he  took a 10-hour train ride to get to Kyiv,  

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,520
with virtually no one in the world knowing  about it until he was there. National  

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Security Council spokesman John Kirby says the  situation is different; Tel Aviv isn't Kyiv:

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,320
The security situation is certainly tense, of  course, uh, but we take all those factors into  

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,840
account when we both plan the president's trip  and when we make a decision to, uh, to preview it.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Polling shows at this moment moment Americans  are very much in favor of showing strong support  

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,120
for Israel, and that support for an ally at war  is a big part of Biden's agenda with this trip.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,080
Tamara Keith, NPR News.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,400
Meanwhile, Israel continues to strike  at Hamas and Hezbollah targets in both  

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,680
Gaza and in Lebanon. NPR's Peter  Kenyon reports from Jerusalem:

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,440
After an intense 24 hours of continued air  strikes, the Israeli military said it had killed  

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,720
Osama Mazini, a Hamas official responsible  for those taken prisoner by Hamas and who,  

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,880
"directed terrorist activities against Israel." To  the north, the IDF announced that it was striking  

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,600
Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and later said it  had carried out strikes against what it called  

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,640
terror targets and infrastructure of the Hezbollah  terrorist organization in Lebanon, adding that it  

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,920
was in response to fire Monday toward Israel. The  IDF Chief of Staff released a message to soldiers  

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,920
saying, in part, "we took a hard hit and we are  responsible, but now the initiative is in our  

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,360
hands. The war will be difficult and long," the  message continued, "but the IDF will prevail."

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,480
Peter Kenyan, NPR News, Jerusalem.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,280
As Israel continues bombing Gaza, the situation  for Palestinians remains desperate. Palestinian  

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,120
health officials say the air strikes have left  nearly 2,800 people dead. Israel is blocking all  

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,800
water, food and fuel from entering the Palestinian  enclave. Relief groups in other countries say the  

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,200
situation is catastrophic: People in hospitals  cannot get medical aid; there is fear of  

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,240
disease as people drink dirty water. The U.S. is  pushing Israel to allow relief aid to enter Gaza.

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,360
Many people turned out in a Chicago suburb  yesterday to mourn a 6-year-old boy who was  

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,800
stabbed to death by his landlord,  allegedly. Wadea Al-Fayoume was  

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,160
Palestinian American. Prosecutors alleged  the landlord targeted him because of his  

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,800
family's Muslim faith. Mahmoud Yousef  is the boy's great uncle; he says the  

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
fighting between Israel and Hamas militants  should not be reflected here in the U.S.:

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,160
You want war? It's overseas. It's not  our war. It's not United States' war,  

38
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,640
and we're gathering here to say  we need to save our kids — I'm not  

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,840
just staying about Palestinians;  I'm staying about our, our kids.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,560
The landlord is charged with murder.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,280
There may be a vote later today in the House  to select a new Speaker. Republicans have the  

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,840
majority and Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan  won a GOP leadership contest last week,  

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,440
but he did not have near unanimity of GOP support.  

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,600
New York Congressman Marc Molinaro  says Jordan has won his backing:

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,400
He's assured me that members like me and the  people I represent will have a voice at the table  

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,400
and uh, uh he's, uh, understands that we need  to govern and, for that, I'll be voting for him.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,680
But it's not clear if Jordan has enough  support: If all members are voting,  

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
Jordan can only afford to lose a few  Republicans in order to win the Speaker's gavel.

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,160
