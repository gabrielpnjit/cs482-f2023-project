The first 2024 Republican presidential debate  is tonight in Wisconsin. Eight candidates are  

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,100
expected to be on the debate stage in  Milwaukee for the event organized by the  

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,240
Republican National Committee. Chuck  Quirmbach, with member station WUWM,  

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,680
says former President Donald Trump  remains the front-runner for the party's  

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,180
presidential nomination, but he won't  be taking part in this initial debate:

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,500
"Trump is skipping the Milwaukee debate  in favor of an interview with former Fox  

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,040
News host Tucker Carlson. Carroll University  political science Professor Lilly Goren says  

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,820
that will change things for the eight  Republican candidates who are debating:

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,420
'Some of the candidates having greater  exposure on the national level and also,  

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,720
to some degree, what they may say in  regard to former President Trump.'

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,540
"The Democratic National Committee says the debate  

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,840
will introduce America to an  extreme slate of candidates.

"For NPR News, I'm Chuck Quirmbach, in Milwaukee."

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,380
Officials in Hawaii say more than 1,000 people  remain unaccounted for in the aftermath of the  

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,220
wildfires on Maui. The official death toll remains  at 115, as efforts continue to locate additional  

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,680
human remains in the charred rubble of buildings.  NPR's Jennifer Ludden says authorities are asking  

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,380
relatives of the missing to submit DNA samples  to help identify additional victims of the fires:

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,180
"The FBI is leading this effort. At  a news conference, an agent reassured  

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,200
people their DNA would not be used for  anything but matching with the remains  

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,660
of wildfire victims. He also said samples  from multiple family members is best. But  

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,120
the fire in the historic town of Lahaina  was so intense some DNA analysis might be  

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,160
difficult. Maui Police Chief John Pelletier  said they may not find everyone who died:

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,700
'When this is all said and done, realistically  — let's be honest here — we're going to have a  

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,120
number of confirmed; we're going  to have a number of presumed.'

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,340
"The county did reveal the names of  eight more victims — almost all seniors.

Ethiopia says it will work with Saudi Arabian  authorities to investigate allegations by Human  

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,920
Rights Watch that Saudi border guards killed  Ethiopian migrants. Michael Kaloki has more:

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,780
"A Human Rights Watch a report claims that,  between March last year and June this year,  

34
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,180
Saudi Arabian border guards killed hundreds of  Ethiopian migrants who tried to cross into Saudi

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,340
Arabia from Yemen. Ethiopia said it will work  alongside Saudi authorities to investigate the  

36
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,260
allegations. Human Rights Watch claims that  the alleged killings could amount to crimes  

37
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,640
against humanity. Saudi Arabian authorities  have previously rejected the allegations."
