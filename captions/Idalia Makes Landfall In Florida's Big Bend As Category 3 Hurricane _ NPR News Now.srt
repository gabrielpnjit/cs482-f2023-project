Good morning. I'm Kristin Wright, with NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

Hurricane Idalia has made landfall along  Florida's Gulf Coast. In the past hour,  

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,180
sustained wind speeds decreased slightly,  downgrading it to a Category 3 storm, but storm  

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,000
surge and catastrophic flooding remain a serious  threat to communities. Elliot Tritto, of member

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,660
station WUFT, reports hospitals in Florida are  ready to receive a possible influx of patients:

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,860
"Hospitals in North Central Florida are  preparing for what could be a lot of patients

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,640
with storm-related injuries. Matt Shannon is  an emergency physician with the University  

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,080
of Florida. He says it's happened with every  hurricane affecting the area. In his experience,  

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,500
the wave of patience comes not  during the hurricane, but after:

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,300
'Most people will have the good sense to stay  home and button down the hatches. It's, uh, we  

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,800
tend to get large emergency department volumes  the day after those storms pass through.'

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,540
"He says to take precautions, like wearing  eye protection during post-storm cleanup. For  

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,860
anyone riding out the storm, he says to use  common sense, wait for it to blow over and,  

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,300
if you have a small injury, take care of it at  home, but if it's a major injury, call 9-1-1.

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,860
Hawaii's power grid and strengthen its  ability to withstand future disasters.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is  wrapping up talks in China. Raimondo is  

22

the latest Biden administration official  to visit China in a bid to ease tense  

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,040
trade relations. Secretary Raimondo  spoke to reporters in Shanghai today:

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,860
"I explained very clearly that, as  a Commerce Secretary, it's my job to  

25
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,280
both protect what we must — to protect our  technology — and to promote where we can."

A new Gallup survey shows labor unions remain  popular in the U.S. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports:

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,600
"The survey actually found public approval of  unions has fallen a few percentage points from a  

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,780
year ago — it's now at 67%, which is still higher  than it's been for most of the past half-century.  

29
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,440
Support for union workers also appears strong —  72% of respondents said they sympathize more with  

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,040
Hollywood writers than with Hollywood studios; 75%  said they'd side with the United Auto Workers over  

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,880
the auto companies. At the same time, a sizable  minority of people question what good unions do —  

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,060
one out of three said unions mostly hurt the U.S.  economy. The survey results come as health care
