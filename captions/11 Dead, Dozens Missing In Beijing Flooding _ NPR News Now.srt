A federal jury begins deliberations today

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,240
over the sentence for the 2018  Pittsburgh synagogue shooter.

And at least 11 people have died in  flooding in Beijing's western suburbs.

Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,320
A federal jury opens deliberation today  on the sentence for the man who shot and  

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,800
killed 11 Jewish worshipers at a Pittsburgh  synagogue in 2018. From member station WESA,

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,240
Julia Zenkovich reports jurors could  decide he should receive the death penalty:

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,160
"In their closing arguments Monday, prosecutors  argued that Bowers has shown no remorse for  

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,780
committing the deadliest antisemitic attack  in U.S. history. They also contend that  

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,220
the aggravating factors, including Bowers'  antisemitic and white supremacist beliefs,  

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,180
outweigh the mitigating factors, such  as any mental health issues he may have.  

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,860
Defense lawyers reminded jurors that they must  weigh mitigating and aggravating factors and  

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,240
come to an individual moral judgment.  They say Bowers' tumultuous childhood  

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,320
and mental illnesses should persuade the  jury to sentence him to life in prison.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,260
"For NPR News, I'm Julia  Zenkovich, in Pittsburgh."

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,980
Police in Memphis, Tennessee, shot  and critically wounded a man who  

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,240
had opened fire at the building of  a Jewish school yesterday. He had  

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,100
tried and failed to get inside. No one  in the Memphis Jewish school was hurt.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,000
Federal health officials want to find  out more about the condition known as  

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
"Long-COVID." NPR's Will Stone reports they've  

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,720
launched a handful of new studies to  test different potential treatments:

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,640
"The National Institutes of Health is opening  enrollment in four clinical trials. One is  

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,420
exploring the theory that the virus somehow  persists in the body after the infection.  

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,140
Patients will be given the antiviral  Paxlovid to see if that improves their  

25
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,240
symptoms. Another focuses on brain fog and  cognitive dysfunction, leveraging web-based  

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,280
brain training programs and a popular brain  stimulation method. Other trials will look at  

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,660
drugs that could improve sleep problems, as well  as symptoms associated with irregular heartbeat,  

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,460
dizziness and fatigue. While there are specialized  clinics for treating 'Long-COVID,' there are still  

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,780
huge gaps in our understanding of its  underlying causes and how to treat it.

"Will Stone, NPR News."

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,980
Searing heat is sticking around the  central U.S. today. Heat indexes will  

32
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,900
hover around 110 degrees from Kansas  and Missouri down to the Gulf Coast  

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,180
of Alabama and Louisiana. Forecasters  say this heat will push to the east.

In China, at least 11 people have  died and dozens more are missing  

35
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,720
amid flooding in the western suburbs  of Beijing. NPR's Aowen Cao has more:

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,460
"The intense spring has prompted Beijing to close  tourist attractions like the Forbidden City,  

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,860
but the most affected areas are the city's  outer districts. Riverbeds that usually stay  

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,860
dry for much of the year were overwhelmed by  downpours. Around 120,000 people in vulnerable  

39
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,960
communities have been evacuated to school  gyms, according to state media. The city's  

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,720
government announced on Tuesday that two rescue  workers were among those killed. This level of  

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,820
rainfall is highly unusual for Beijing, a  city that enjoys a dry climate. However,  

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,080
more and more northern regions in China  have reported floods in recent years.
