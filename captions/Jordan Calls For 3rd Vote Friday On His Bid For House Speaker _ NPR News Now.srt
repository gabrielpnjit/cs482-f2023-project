00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,560
Jim Jordan says he plans to  move ahead with a third vote  

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,640
on his bid to become House Speaker later today.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,840
And Israel has ordered thousands of people  

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,520
to evacuate a town near its  northern border with Lebanon.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,600
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,200
Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan is pushing ahead  with his bid to become Speaker of the House.  

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,280
he's failed twice this week, and he lost  more Republican lawmakers in the second  

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,840
round of voting than he did in the first.  Jordan doesn't seem to be bothered by that:

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,160
We picked up a few, we lost a few — I think  the ones we lost can come back — so, uh, look:  

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,160
There's been multiple rounds of votes for Speaker  before, um, we all know that. I just know that we  

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,240
need to get a Speaker as soon as possible so  we can get to work for the American people.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,840
A third vote could happen this morning, but  the opposition to Jordan from some Republicans  

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,160
seems entrenched. Many members have complained  that Jordan and his supporters have bullied and  

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,120
threatened them, their staffs and their families.  Jordan has said he opposes the harassment.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,240
Israel is ordering thousands of people to  evacuate a town near the northern border with  

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,000
Lebanon. Cross-border attacks from Hezbollah  are continuing. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports  

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,720
Israel also launched more strikes in Gaza,  hitting a Greek Orthodox Church compound:

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Israel began evacuating a town not far from the  Lebanese border — the second such evacuation order  

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,560
to be issued and the latest sign that a ground  invasion of the Gaza Strip may be imminent.  

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,960
Israel's Defense Minister told troops to be  prepared to see Gaza from the inside. Palestinians  

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,720
in Gaza, meanwhile, report heavy air strikes  in Khan Yunis and the Interior Ministry says  

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,440
an air strike late Thursday at a church compound  left a large number of dead and wounded. The IDF  

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,520
said it was looking into the reported strike  on the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,720
Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Jerusalem.

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,960
Palestinians stuck in southern Gaza still  cannot access aid. Many trucks carrying water,  

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,160
food and medicine are waiting across the border,  in Egypt. The U.N. Secretary-General is at the  

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,600
border crossing urging officials in Israel and  Egypt to allow aid to go through. President  

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,520
Biden said earlier he secured promises from  both countries to allow aid to enter Gaza.

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,800
The Justice Department says former President  Donald Trump is not entitled to blanket  

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,080
immunity from criminal prosecution.  NPR's Carrie Johnson reports this  

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,240
claim is from the federal case alleging  Trump interfered in the 2020 election:

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,360
Prosecutors working for Special  Counsel Jack Smith say there's no  

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,080
legal or historical support for the idea  that former presidents should be shielded  

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,800
from accountability for their crimes. The  Justice Department is urging a judge to  

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,880
reject Trump's bid to dismiss four felony  charges against him in a Washington, D.C.,  

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,200
Court. Trump says he simply tried to protect  the integrity of the last presidential election,  

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,400
but prosecutors said he led a conspiracy to  overturn the election results and keep himself  

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,360
in power despite the will of the voters. Judge  Tanya Chutkan will resolve the issue. Trump may  

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,520
be positioning for an appeal to the Supreme Court,  which could delay the trial, set for March 2024.
