A second shipment of food,  water and medical supplies  

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,240
has crossed the border from Egypt into Gaza.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,400
And Australia's prime minister is  planning to travel to Beijing next month.

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,360
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,680
The Israel Defense Forces say they conducted well  over 300 strikes on targets in Gaza overnight  

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,720
as the war between Israel and Hamas continues.  Israel says Hamas killed 1,400 people — mostly  

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,280
Israelis — when the militants attacked two  weeks ago. Palestinian health authoritities  

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,720
now say at least 4,600 Palestinians have  been killed in Israeli air strikes in Gaza.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,440
A second shipment of humanitarian aid  has arrived in Gaza. NPR's Jackie Northam  

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,720
reports from Jerusalem it was limited to  14 trucks with water, food and medicine:

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,880
The second convoy of aid trucks passed  through the Rafa Crossing after a long  

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,680
delay. Each truck was thoroughly inspected to  make sure no weapons bound for Hamas militants  

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,720
were on board. Relief workers say the supplies  are just a fraction of what's needed for the  

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,840
more than 700,000 Palestinians who have fled  their homes in Northern Gaza to escape constant  

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,680
air strikes by the Israeli military. On Sunday,  President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister  

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,320
Benjamin Netanyahu and affirmed there would be  a continued flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.  

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,600
That could change if and when an anticipated  Israeli incursion into Gaza gets underway.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,360
Republican congressman George Santos  will be a key vote this week as the  

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,320
GOP struggles to elect a new House Speaker.  But the scandal-plagued congressman from New  

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,480
York is also expected back in federal court  on Long Island. NPR's Brian Mann explains:

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,560
George Santos posted on social media that  he expects to receive the longest Speaker  

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,480
ballot in modern history this week, describing  it as a historic mark for the 118th Congress.  

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,560
Candidates for the speakership have so far  failed to receive the 217 votes needed to  

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,640
lead the narrowly divided House, and Santos' vote  could be crucial, but if the process drags on,  

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,240
Santos is also scheduled back in  federal court on Long Island Friday,  

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,880
facing new felony corruption counts. Federal  prosecutors say Santos tried to rack up big,  

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,360
unauthorized charges on the credit cards of his  political donors. Santos has admitted lying to  

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,800
voters about much of his life's story, but denies  any criminal wrongdoing. Earlier this month,  

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,840
his campaign treasurer pleaded guilty to  charges linked to her work on his campaign.

Australia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, says  he will travel to Beijing next month. NPR's Emily  

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,000
Fang says he'll be the first Australian  leader to visit China in seven years:

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Tensions with China escalated after Australia's  then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for  

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,000
an independent investigation into the origins of  COVID in China in 2020, but since being elected to  

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
power last year, Albanese's government has sought  to ease tensions with Beijing. He'll attend a  

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,640
big export fair in China next month. China's  release of an Australian political prisoner,  

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,600
the journalist Cheng Lei, this month,  also marked a diplomatic breakthrough.
