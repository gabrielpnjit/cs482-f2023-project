00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Prosecutors are seeking a protective  order today against former President  

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,960
Donald Trump in his election interference case.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,160
And more gay and bisexual  men can now donate blood.

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,320
Good morning. I'm Nora Raum, with NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,080
The Justice Department is asking a judge  to issue a protective order against former  

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,540
President Donald Trump. The DOJ says it's  seeking to prevent Trump from disclosing  

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,700
evidence related to the four-count indictment  against him stemming from Trump's alleged  

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,600
efforts to try to overturn the results of the  2020 election. NPR's Joe Hernandez reports:

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,100
"In their motion for the order, federal  prosecutors pointed to Trump's history of  

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,200
making social media posts about legal matters  against him, including a post he made on Truth  

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,540
Social Friday in which he wrote that he'd go  after anyone who went after him. Trump's attorney,  

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,120
John Lauro, slammed the idea of a protective  order in an interview on ABC's 'This Week':

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,820
'What the Biden administration is trying to do is  prevent the press from learning about exculpatory  

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,260
and, and helpful information — evidence —  that the people have a right to know about.'

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,320
"Trump's attorneys wanted more time to respond to  

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,040
the Justice Department's proposal  but the judge denied that request.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,140
"Joe Hernandez, NPR News."

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,820
The judge ordered the Trump team tp  file an answer by 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,700
A trio of federal voting rights lawsuits  is heading to trial today in Galveston,  

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,360
Texas. Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider  reports the combined case is the first major  

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,720
trial of its kind since the Supreme Court upheld  a key clause of the Voting Rights Act in June:

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,320
"The three lawsuits charge Galveston  County with racial discrimination,  

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,720
violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  The county is nearly half Black and Latino.  

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,700
One of the county's four voting districts used  to be made up of a majority of Black and Latino  

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,580
residents. In 2021, the Republican-led County  Commissioners Court redrew its map to split the  

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,440
non-white population across all four districts,  so they do not comprise a majority anywhere,  

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,140
and now County Commissioner Stephen Holmes, who  is Black and a Democrat, is far more likely to  

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,640
lose his re-election bid next year if the map  is allowed to stand. Lawyers for the county  

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,200
say the new map was partisan, which the U.S.  Supreme Court has allowed, and not racial.

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
"For NPR News, I'm Andrew Schneider, in Houston."

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,060
New guidelines from the Food and Drug  Administration take effect today, allowing  

32
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,380
more gay and bisexual men to donate blood. Nick  de la Canal, with member station WFAE, reports:

33
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,700
"The previous rules were intended to protect  blood recipients from HIV, but they were called  

34
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,620
discriminatory by many advocates. Under the new  rules, only people who've had anal sex with new  

35
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,360
or multiple partners or take HIV prevention  drugs will be asked to wait three months  

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,740
before donating. The agency says it will keep  monitoring the safety of the blood supply."

37
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,200
Nick de la Canal reporting.

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,980
Three people were killed when two  helicopters collided in Southern  

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,780
California yesterday. They were carrying  fire crews fighting a blaze. The crash  

40
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,240
sparked another fire, which has been extinguished.
