Without a Speaker of the House, work  in Congress grinds to a halt today.

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,800
And classes have been called off  at Morgan State University today,  

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,440
in Maryland, after a shooting on campus  last night left five people injured.

Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,720
Work in the House of Representatives grinds  to a halt today now that Congressman Kevin  

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,080
McCarthy has been forced out as  Speaker. From member station KVPR,  

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,560
Joshua Yeager reports McCarthy says  he won't run for speaker again:

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,800
"McCarthy kept his head held high during an  

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,160
hourlong news conference following his  unprecedented ouster as House Speaker:

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,480
'So I may have lost a vote today,  but as I walk out of this chamber,  

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,080
I feel fortunate to have  served the American people.'

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,200
"His firing was prompted by a stopgap bill  to continue funding the government with  

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,240
support from Democrats. A defiant  McCarthy said he had no regrets:

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,920
'You know, if you have to lose for something,  

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,640
I will always lose for the country —  it is a much better battle to have.'

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,000
"Any successor will face a deeply divided  Congress and a costly shutdown looming weeks away.

"For NPR News, I'm Joshua Yeager, in Bakersfield."

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
In a hypothetical two-way matchup for  president in 2024, President Biden and  

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,320
former President Donald Trump are in a  dead heat. That's according to the latest  

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,360
NPR/PBS/NewsHour/Marist poll. As NPR's Danielle  Kurtzleben reports, third-party candidates would  

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,640
make for a more complicated race, but it's  not clear if they would spoil it either way:

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,440
"The poll also matched up Biden and Trump  with a generic Green Party candidate,  

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,640
a generic Libertarian candidate and another  generic third-party candidate. In that race,  

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,560
around one in five Americans chose a  third-party candidate or were undecided.  

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,480
However, that still left Trump and Biden with  roughly even shares of the vote. Of course,  

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,720
Trump hasn't won the GOP nomination, but the  poll also found him much more popular among  

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,040
the GOP electorate than his primary opponents: 74%  of GOP voters view Trump favorably; the only other  

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,520
GOP candidate seen favorably by even a majority of  GOP voters was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, at 58%.

Baltimore police say someone opened fire last  night on the campus of Morgan State University,  

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,600
in Maryland. Five people were hurt. Baltimore  

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,040
Police Commissioner Richard Worley says  their injuries are not life-threatening:

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,120
"We did not locate the suspect at this time,  

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,760
um, the scene remains active, and  we are working alongside our many  

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
federal law enforcement partners to piece  together everything exactly happened."

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,600
Classes have been cancelled  today at Morgan State University.

This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry is being  shared by three scientists: Moungi Bawendi,  

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov. They're being  cited for their discoveries among the smallest  

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,440
particles in nanotechnology. These so-called  quantum dots spread their light from LED lamps,  

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,800
and they help guide surgeons when they remove  tissue with tumors in them. The Nobel Prize  

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,560
in literature will be awarded tomorrow. The  Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday.
