Wildfires have devastated the  historic town of Lahaina and  

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,220
claimed the lives of at least 55 people in Maui.

3

And driverless taxis have been given the  green light to operate in San Francisco.

Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston, with  NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,680
Fast-moving wildfires continue to  rage across Maui, leaving widespread  

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,800
destruction in their path. The blazes have  decimated the historic town of Lahaina,  

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,980
a popular destination for tourists. Tiffany  Kidder Winn owns a business there. She says  

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,180
she returned to the community yesterday  to get a first-hand look at the damage:

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,980
"As I walked, though, it started getting worse  — power lines down and then started to see  

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,140
smoke and, I mean, there was smoke everywhere,  but it was getting thicker, and cars burned,  

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,980
and apartment complexes burned. And  the further we got onto Front Street,  

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,220
the more devastating it was  — just everything leveled."

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,000
Authorities say the wildfire that engulfed  Lahaina is now 80% contained. At least 55  

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,680
people have died in the fires, with  the death toll expected to rise.

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,020
Attorneys for former President Donald  Trump will be in court today in Washington,  

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,460
D.C. NPR's Kristin Wright reports prosecutors in  the 2020 election conspiracy case are asking a  

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,520
judge for a protective order that would seek to  prevent Trump from improperly sharing evidence:

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,220
"Special Counsel Jack Smith's team is legally  required to disclose evidence in the case to  

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,780
former President Trump and his defense team.  Prosecutors are concerned Trump will reveal  

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,940
sensitive information and target witnesses,  compromising the trial. Prosecutors requested  

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,620
a protective order last Friday, hours after  the former president posted on his Truth Social  

22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,140
platform, "If you go after me, I'm coming after  you." Trump defends his comments, made the day  

23
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,000
after his arraignment, saying a protective  order would violate his free speech. Today,  

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,460
a judge is hearing arguments from both sides.  Last week, Trump pleaded not guilty to conspiring  

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,200
to overturn the results of the 2020 election  and block the peaceful transition of power.

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,140
A utilities commission in California has voted to  

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,400
allow driverless car companies to  act like taxis in San Francisco,  

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,000
but as NPR's Dara Kerr reports, they're  facing resistance from emergency responders:

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
"The San Francisco police and fire  departments have been vocal about  

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,180
their opposition to driverless cars.  They say the vehicles have impeded  

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,620
first responders' operations, running  through yellow emergency tape and  

33
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,540
blocking firehouse driveways. Here's San  Francisco Fire Chief Jeanine Nicholson:

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,440
'Our folks cannot be paying  attention to an autonomous  

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,600
vehicle when we've got ladders to throw.'

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,520
"Nicholson has been urging California's  transportation regulator to halt the growth  

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,140
of driverless vehicle programs  in the city, but in a 3-1 vote,  

38
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,600
regulators decided to allow the programs  to expand. Now, autonomous vehicles run by  

39
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,280
Cruise and Waymo can pick up passengers  and charge a fare, just like a taxi.

The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season will  likely be more active than first predicted.  

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,540
That's according to the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration. NPR's Jeff  

43

Brady reports NOAA says warmer waters in the  Atlantic could fuel up to 21 storms this year:

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,500
"At the start of the summer, NOAA predicted  a near-normal number of named hurricanes and  

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,360
tropical storms this year in the Atlantic.  Now, the agency projects an above-normal  

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,520
level of activity. Matthew Rosencrans, with  NOAA, says warmer water is the main reason:

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,980
'The June-July sea surface temperature in  the main development region of the North  

48
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,760
Atlantic were the warmest since 1950, at  1.23 degrees Centigrade above normal.'

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,500
"There's a global trend of rising ocean  temperatures due, at least in part,  

50
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,340
to climate change, though scientists  are still trying to understand what's  

51
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,100
driving the current record-breaking ocean heat.
