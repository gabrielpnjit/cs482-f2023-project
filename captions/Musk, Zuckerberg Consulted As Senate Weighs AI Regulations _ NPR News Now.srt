A federal judge in Texas has again  struck down the DACA program.

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,840
And crews continue to search for bodies in  Morocco after last Friday's deadly earthquake.

Good morning. I'm Nora Raum, with NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,700
A federal judge in Texas has again struck  down a program that protects undocumented  

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,040
immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally  as children. From member station KERA,  

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,660
Stella Chávez reports the latest  ruling blocks efforts to codify the  

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,920
policy known as DACA — Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,440
"U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen previously  declared the DACA program unlawful two years  

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,720
ago. His latest order is in response to  a request from nine Republican-led states  

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,240
to find the Biden administration's  efforts illegal and end DACA. Hanen's  

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,700
decision keeps deportation and work permit  protections in place for the nearly 600,000  

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,540
current DACA recipients, but new applications  can't be processed. The Biden administration  

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,460
is expected to appeal and the case will  likely return to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"I'm Stella Chávez, in Dallas."

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,080
The Senate held a closed-door meeting yesterday  to hear from the nation's big biggest technology  

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,140
executives on artificial intelligence. Majority  Leader Chuck Schumer had organized the conference,  

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,520
saying everyone agreed the government  has a role in the oversight of AI:

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,540
"Our work is just beginning — we  need to have more of these forums,  

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,600
and we need to get our committees working  on different parts of legislation because,  

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,600
again, to not act would be something  that, something we want to avoid."

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,280
There apparently was no agreement yesterday  on what government regulation would look like.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,000
In Morocco, authorities say there is no hope of  finding anyone else alive after last Friday's  

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,240
earthquake. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports  rescue crews are still searching for bodies:

24
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,800
"58-year-old Brahim Agoudahid weeps as  he describes the wonderful life in his  

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,900
village of Imi N'Tala before the earthquake.  The indigenous Berber village perched in the  

26
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,100
rocky Atlas Mountains got tourists from around the  world. Now, Imi N'Tala is a scene of devastation  

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,980
and wreckage after part of the mountain sheared  off and crushed it. On this day, rescue teams  

28
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,360
with dogs were able to extract a few bodies from  the rubble after hours of digging. Within minutes,  

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,120
they were placed back into the ground next to  the ruined village as men prayed and women wept.

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,480
Rescue teams in the Libyan city of Derna are  searching for people still missing after a huge  

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,500
flash flood Sunday night. The Associated Press  reports at least 5,100 people have died and  

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,140
thousands more are missing and feared dead as a  result of Storm Daniel. Aid workers say the flood  

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,940
destroyed the center of the densely populated  city and that there are bodies everywhere.
