President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  travels to Washington today  

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,300
as Congress weighs whether to  approve more aid for Ukraine.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,840
And the Senate has confirmed a new  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,160
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,220
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in  Washington, D.C., today to meet with President  

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,400
Biden. He's asking for sustained U.S. military  aid to help Ukraine resist Russia's invasion.  

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,340
NPR's Windsor Johnston tells us Zelenskyy will  also visit congressional leaders on Capitol Hill:

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,740
"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is expected to  meet with Zelenskyy, but he has no plans to  

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,500
provide the Ukrainian leader with a forum to make  a direct appeal to lawmakers for additional aid.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,560
"On the Senate side, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  has organized a meeting with the entire chamber.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,060
"Speaking at the United Nations this week,  Zelenskyy said, without continued support,  

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,880
Russia will expand its fight within Ukraine."

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,040
NPR's Windsor Johnston reporting.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,800
The Senate has voted overwhelmingly to confirm  a new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:  

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,220
Air Force General C.Q. Brown is the second  Black officer to hold the post. As NPR's Greg  

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,340
Myre reports, the Senate action circumvented  a monthlong blockade by a Republican senator:

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,960
"In a distinguished career, General Brown  has served as a combat pilot and as Chief  

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,060
of the Air Force for the past three years.  However, Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville  

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,860
blocked the confirmation of Brown and hundreds  of other military officers who would normally  

20
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,160
be approved in large batches. Tuberville objects  to a Pentagon policy that helps military members  

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,740
travel to receive abortion care if they face  local restrictions. To get around Tuberville,  

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,320
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer brought  Brown's nomination to a full Senate vote. He  

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,500
was confirmed 83-11. Brown replaces General Mark  Milley, who steps down at the end of the month.  

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,780
The only other Black officer to be Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs was General Colin Powell.

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,660
"Greg Myre, NPR News, Washington."

26
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,720
India has suspended visa services for  Canadian citizens indefinitely. There  

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,880
are escalating tensions over the murder of  a Sikh leader in Canada. Sushmita Pathak  

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,400
reports Canada claims India was involved in  the killing, a charge that New Delhi rejects:

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,560
"The form that handles Indian visa applications  in Canada said the service has been suspended due  

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,200
to operational reasons. India has also issued an  advisory for its citizens in Canada, especially  

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,240
the large student population, urging them to  remain vigilant as the diplomatic row worsens.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,560
"Canada's government is investigating  India's connection to the murder of a  

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,240
separatist Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar.  India has strongly condemned the allegation.

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,660
"Both countries have expelled top diplomats.

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,220
"Calls for a Sikh nation-state separate from  India have been growing among the large Sikh  

36
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,160
diaspora in Canada. India considers its supporters  terrorists and accuses Canada of sheltering them.
