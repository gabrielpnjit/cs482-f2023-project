Good morning. I'm Louise Schiavone,  NPR News. Today is Tuesday,

00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,560
August 22nd, and here are today's top stories:

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,260
Officials on the Hawaiian island of Maui have  released two more names of victims from the  

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,620
historic blaze there two weeks ago. The death  toll stands at 115, up one from yesterday. 35  

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,220
victims have been identified. At the same time,  more than 800 people on Maui remain unaccounted  

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,900
for. The question is did they perish or have  they not checked in with family or friends?

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,540
President Biden and First Lady Joe Biden toured  the wildfire devastation on Maui yesterday,  

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,780
later pledging sustained federal support at a  community event at the Lahaina Civic Center.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,860
Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono  says the loss is profound,  

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,300
especially considering the modest  local government coffers on Maui:

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,560
"It is going to be a lot of money, and  this county has suffered tremendous  

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,340
losses — because their county budget  doesn't cover anything of this magnitude."

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,940
The blaze on Maui was the  deadliest wildfire in U.S. history.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,340
Recovery efforts are underway in Southern  California in the aftermath of flash floods  

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,360
and mudslides brought on by Tropical Storm Hilary.  From member station KVCR, Madison Aument reports:

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,560
"The resort town of Palm Springs and  surrounding desert cities east of Los  

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,000
Angeles received some three inches of  rain. The area typically sees roughly  

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,720
5 inches a year. Shane Reichardt is  a spokesman for Riverside County,  

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,180
that includes Palm Springs. He says, now that the  sun is out, the county is assessing the damage:

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,900
'We're such a large county, with 7,300 square  miles, that there's a lot of area to check.'

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,560
"He says flooding is still blocking  roads in Palm Springs, and the storm  

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,300
knocked out the 911 emergency call system  there on Sunday night. Emergency officials  

23
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,920
also have their eye on debris flows in  areas where wildfires burned recently.

"For NPR News, I'm Madison  Aument, in San Bernardino."

25
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,020
The FDA has approved the first RSV vaccine to  be taken during pregnancy. The shot will protect  

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,080
newborn babies during their vulnerable first  months of life. NPR's Sydney Lupkin has details:

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,780
"The FDA has approved a new tool in the  arsenal against RSV. The virus causes mild,  

28
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,280
cold-like symptoms in most people,  

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,680
but can be serious in young children and older  adults. Pfizer studied the vaccine in more than  

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,260
7,000 pregnant women across 18 countries.  The vaccine was 82% effective at preventing  

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,180
severe disease in infants during their first  three months of life, and 70% effective in the  

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,740
first six months. Dr. Scott Roberts, from the  Yale School of Medicine, says it's good news:

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,440
'I think a lot of us in the medical community  are facing the winter ahead with some optimism  

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,760
and enthusiasm that we now have several  options that are coming down the pipeline.'

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,840
"Last month, the FDA also approved a  monoclonal antibody shot for babies  

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,200
up to 24 months old. It's made by AstraZeneca.
