00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,400
Former President Donald Trump and 18  others have been indicted in Georgia  

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,900
over alleged efforts to overturn  the results of the 2020 election.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,880
And the search continues for human  remains on the island of Maui.

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,580
Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston, with  NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,000
Prosecutors in Georgia have indicted  former President Donald Trump. NPR's  

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,420
Carrie Johnson reports Trump and 18 others  are facing a barrage of criminal charges for  

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,280
their alleged efforts to overturn the  state's results of the 2020 election:

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,460
"Beyond the the overarching charge of a  racketeering, there are a number of other,  

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,340
more specific charges, including solicitation  of violation of oath by public officer,  

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,580
false statements and writings, and  impersonating a public officer, forgery,  

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,360
some document-related charges  and false statements charges."

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,000
That's NPR's Carrie Johnson reporting.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,880
Access to west Maui is still being  restricted as authorities continue  

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,540
to search for human remains in Lahaina after  deadly wildfires. Officials in Hawaii say at  

15
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,360
least 99 people have died in the fires.  NPR's Lauren Sommer reports residents on  

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,000
the island are feeling isolated, lacking  power and cell service in some areas:

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,860
"We're hearing from some residents in Lahaina that  they're eager to get back to central Maui — there,  

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,320
they can get better wifi, supplies and even  search for loved ones. The more direct route  

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,580
there is being restricted by authorities; they  say that road needs to be left open for utility  

20
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,680
trucks and supply chains. If residents  leave, they have to take a much longer,  

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,260
hourlong road that's very windy and dangerous.  Today, residents in Lahaina got a text message  

22
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,700
that they should gather to get special  placards to put in their cars to speed  

23
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,320
their return to Lahaina. Many waited hours  to get their placard. The site was quickly  

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,220
overwhelmed, and authorities shut it down  and said they are abandoning that system.

"Lauren Sommer, NPR News, Lahaina."

26
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,760
Lawyers in Alabama are awaiting a ruling from  federal judges over whether the state's new  

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,700
congressional map satisfies a Supreme Court  ruling early this year. Stephan Bisaha,  

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,220
of Gulf States Newsroom, reports the state was  ordered to create two majority black districts,  

29
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,540
but the panel of judges raised questions  over the state's new submission:

30
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,300
"Alabama's justification for ignoring the Supreme  Court? A new map and new rules means the court's  

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,580
order no longer matters. Alabama recently changed  its standards for drawing congressional maps,  

32
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,380
so the state's attorneys say its newest map  should be judged against those new standards,  

33
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,700
not whether it made two districts where a  minority candidate had a chance at winning.  

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,140
The three federal judges running the  hearing did not seem impressed — the  

35
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,000
same judges who initially found Alabama  violated the Voting Rights Act. One judge  

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,200
said it seemed like Alabama deliberately  ignored the court's instructions. If the  

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,000
judges reject the new map, they could appoint  their own officials to draw brand new one.
