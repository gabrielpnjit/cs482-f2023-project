00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,900
President Biden will address the  U.N. General Assembly later today.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,900
And Congress is up against a deadline at the end  

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,660
of the month to avoid a partial  federal government shutdown.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,980
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,580
President Biden and Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,380
will address the U.N. General Assembly today.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,240
NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports Russia's  war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda:

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,280
"Biden administration officials say Russia's  war strikes at the heart of the U.N. charter,  

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,260
and President Biden will reinforce that in his  speech to the General Assembly. For his part,  

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,400
President Zelenskyy is trying to convince  countries that have been on the fence to  

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,740
back his ideas on how the war should end —  that is, with Ukraine sovereignty intact.  

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,120
The conflict has affected countries  around the world — especially those  

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,340
that rely on Ukrainian grain exports. Russia  recently pulled out of a deal that allowed  

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,280
Ukraine to ship food via the Black Sea. The U.N.  Secretary-General is still trying to revive that.

"Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, New York."

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,440
The Indian government has rejected allegations it  was involved in the killing of a Sikh separatist  

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,540
leader in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau made the claim in Parliament yesterday.  

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,640
Sushmita Pathak reports ties between  both countries are at a historic low:

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,140
"The two countries are sparring over the  Khalistan movement, which seeks to establish  

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,420
a Sikh homeland separate from India. India  considers Khalistan supporters terrorists  

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,480
and accuses Canada of sheltering them. In June,  a Sikh separatist leader was shot dead in Canada,  

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,640
and Trudeau accuses India's government of  being involved in it. India's Ministry of  

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,640
External Affairs called the allegations absurd and  motivated. India has expelled a senior Canadian  

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,220
diplomat after Canada removed a top Indian  diplomat. New Delhi has also expressed concerns  

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,720
about what it calls growing interference  by Canada in India's internal affairs.

26

"For NPR News, I'm Sushmita Pathak, in Delhi."

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,880
Congress is working toward a critical deadline  to pass a bill that would keep the federal  

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,640
government open past September 30th. NPR's  Windsor Johnston tells us House Republicans  

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,100
have unveiled a stopgap funding measure; the  Democrats in both chambers are blasting it:

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,260
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  is describing the House proposal as a  

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,660
hard-right screed, accusing Republicans of  refusing to work across the aisle to come up  

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,700
with an agreement. The Biden administration  and Congressional Democrats are demanding a  

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,200
number of provisions that are not included in  the House bill, including additional aid for  

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,320
Ukraine. Without those elements, the stopgap bill  is likely to fail in the Democratic-led Senate."

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,360
NPR's Windsor Johnston reporting.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Policymakers for the U.S. Federal Reserve open  a two-day meeting in Washington today. They're  

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,260
expected to discuss short-term interest rates. The  Fed has raised rates sharply over the last year  

38
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,360
and a half — that's because it is still trying  to get inflation down to its target rate of 2%,  

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,060
but in August, inflation was  running at an annual rate of 3.6%.
