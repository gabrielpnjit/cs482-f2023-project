Good morning. Today is Tuesday,  October 24th. I'm Korva Coleman,  

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,160
from NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,560
An elderly woman taken hostage by Hamas  says she "went through a nightmare" and  

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,600
is relieved to be free. NPR's Peter  Kenyon reports her release comes as  

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,600
the Israeli military continues to  attack Hamas positions in Gaza:

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,800
85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz spoke outside the  Tel Aviv hospital where she's being treated. She  

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,160
said she was taken on a motorcycle as they  raced away and was hit with a wooden pole.  

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,280
Her watch and jewelry were stolen. After  a long walk through underground tunnels,  

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
she said they came to a hall, where they  were guarded. She said it seemed like Hamas,  

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,120
"prepared for this for a long time." The  Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza says  

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,640
nearly 5,800 people have been killed thus  far, including more than 2,300 children.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,760
Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Jerusalem.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,160
French President Emmanuel Macron  is visiting Israel. He met with  

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,800
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today,  

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,960
who warns Israel's fight against Hamas is a  battle with which the West must also engage:

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:11,360
The test for the West and for civilization is  Hamas. If Hamas emerges victorious, we will all  

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,680
lose. Europe will be endangered. Everyone will  be endangered. Civilization will be endangered.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,760
Macron expressed solidarity with Israel:

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,040
This fight against terrorism is obviously matter  

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,120
of existence for Israel, but it's  matter of existence for all of us.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Macron is calling on the international coalition  fighting ISIS to also include fighting Hamas.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,080
Very limited amounts of relief aid are  entering Gaza. Nearly 60 trucks with water,  

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,520
food and medicine have gotten into the enclave in  the past few days many have been delayed in Egypt,  

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,200
waiting for permission to cross.  Israel continues to maintain its  

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,600
blockade of Gaza. It means a cut-off of fuel  needed to power water pumps and hospitals.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,000
House Republicans will meet behind  closed doors today to try again to  

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,520
nominate a speaker. NPR's Susan Davis reports  there are now eight candidates in the race:

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,040
Majority Whip Tom Emmer enters the race with  the strongest initial position to win. The  

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,440
Minnesota representative is the No. 3-elected  Republican in leadership and, prior to that,  

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,560
ran the House Republicans' campaign operation when  the party won the majority in the 2022 midterms.  

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,160
But current leaders have struggled in this Speaker  fight, and Emmer is not as close of an ally to  

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,120
former President Donald Trump as some of his  colleagues would like. Also running: Mike Johnson,  

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,560
of Louisiana — he's also in leadership  and has close with party base activists;  

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,920
Georgia's Austin Scott is making a second run for  the job, and Florida's Byron Donalds. Donalds is  

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,920
a junior lawmaker but part of the Freedom Caucus  and would be the first Black speaker if elected.

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,040
Susan Davis, NPR News, Washington.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,440
Former President Donald Trump is expected to  return to his civil fraud trial in New York  

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,480
today. A key witness is his former lawyer Michael  Cohen. Trump's denied allegations that he wrongly  

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,280
inflated the value of some of his properties.  Cohen is expected to testify against him.
