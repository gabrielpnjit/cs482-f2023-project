00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,100
ash laced with lead, asbestos and other  chemicals. To keep rains from washing  

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,960
toxic debris into the ocean, officials have  wrapped up storm drains. The Coast Guard has  

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,820
also put large booms around eight pipes that  drain into the ocean, says Lt. Trenton Brown:

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,660
'It's like a sponge, and what it does  is it stops that oil, absorbs it,  

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,120
and allows the water and other things to go by.'

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,820
"Officials also warn of possible mudslides  and advise swimmers to avoid any brown water.

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,320

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,160
experienced an earthquake on Sunday, but there  are no immediate reports of damage. Because of  

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,960
the storm, the LA mayor has warned residents  to stay home and avoid getting in their cars  

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,220
