00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Former President Donald Trump is expected to  turn himself in to authorities in Georgia today.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,180
And on Maui, a high school in  Lahaina is fully reopening today.

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,800
Good morning. I'm Jeanine Herbst, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Former President Donald Trump is  expected to turn himself in to  

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,940
the Fulton County Jail later today. Georgia  Public Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler reports  

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,420
Trump faces 13 felony counts for an alleged  effort to overturn Georgia's 2020 election:

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,620
"In some ways, Trump will be like every  other defendant who stepped foot into the  

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,420
Fulton County Jail: He'll be formally arrested,  fingerprinted and processed after being charged  

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,020
last week. But the former president,  who is under Secret Service protection,  

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,880
also was expected to have a booking photo taken  — the first one in the four different indictments  

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,680
he's received in the last few months. After  upstaging the GOP presidential debate last  

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,240
night by refusing to attend, Trump's visit to  Atlanta is expected to dominate headlines again,  

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,740
with his arrival expected to coincide with  evening prime time television viewing hours.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,440
"For NPR News, I'm Stephen Fowler, in Atlanta."

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,240
One high school fully re- or opens  today in the Maui town of Lahaina,  

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,400
where at least 115 people died in a  wildfire earlier this month. Meanwhile,  

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,860
NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports more places  are offering temporary housing to survivors:

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,560
"In addition to hotels, the county says landlords  and property owners across the state have stepped  

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,160
up — they've offered 900 houses, apartments  or rooms for wildfire survivors to rent. A new  

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,200
Maui bus route also starts Thursday; it will  take evacuees between hotels and a shopping  

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,400
mall — a lot of people lost their cars in the  fire, and they have found travel difficult."

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,500
NPR's Jennifer Ludden reporting.

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,240
Schools across the country are leaving  millions — perhaps billions — of federal  

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,340
dollars on the table. That's money that could  help tens of millions of children, including  

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,860
kids with disabilities. Emily Harris reports  on the findings of a new NPR investigation:

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,060
"The money comes from Medicaid, which  covers many health needs for students with  

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,860
disabilities and students from low-income  families. Last year, schools got a total  

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,980
of $6.6 billion. Medicaid officials say they  could be getting much more, but many schools  

29
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,720
say the reimbursement process has been too  cumbersome to be worthwhile. Now, Medicaid  

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,760
has simplified things. Deputy Administrator Dan  Tsai hopes this will get more money into schools:

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,180
'You're talking about things on the  order of magnitude of billions.'

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,380
"First, though, states have to update  their Medicaid policies. So far,  

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,260
at least 22 states have at  least partially done so.

34
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,360
"For NPR News, I'm Emily Harris."

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,780
The head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny  Prigozhin's name was found on the passenger  

36
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,160
list of a plane that crashed with no survivors  north of Moscow, but there is no confirmation  

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,280
that he is dead. Russian state media says 10  bodies were recovered — this just months after  

38
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,160
Prigozhin launched a mutiny against Russia's  military leadership. President Vladimir Putin  

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,780
relies on the Wagner group to supplement  Russian troops in his war against Ukraine.

40
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,360
Republican presidential hopefuls gathered in  Milwaukee for the first Republican presidential  

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
primary debate carried by the Fox News  Channel. They sparred over a number of issues,  

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,620
including the economy, abortion and former  President Donald Trump's alleged efforts  

43
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,820
to overturn the 2020 election.  NPR's Sarah McCammon has more:

44
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,620
"Trump refused to attend the debate, saying  his solid lead in primary polls made his  

45
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,420
participation unnecessary. Moderators asked  the candidates to weigh in on indictments  

46
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,960
he's facing in four jurisdictions  and his actions leading up to the  

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,220
January 6th Insurrection. Former Vice  President Mike Pence said in a debate  

48
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,480
on the Fox News Channel he would support  Trump if he's the Republican nominee,  

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,640
even if he's convicted, but Pence said he could  not support Trump's request on January 6th:

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,420
'He asked me to put him over the Constitution,  and I chose the Constitution — and I always will.'

51
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,340
"Eight Republicans met the criteria to participate  in the Milwaukee debate, which includes signing a  

52
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,620
pledge to support the eventual nominee. The city  also will host the GOP convention next summer.
