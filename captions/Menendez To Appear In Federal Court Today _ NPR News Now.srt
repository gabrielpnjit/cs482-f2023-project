00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,800
New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez is scheduled  to appear in federal court this morning.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,960
And as Hollywood's writers return to work  today, the actors' union's strike continues.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,340
Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,320
New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez  is scheduled to appear in federal court this  

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,040
morning. For member station WNYC, Nancy Solomon  reports he faces charges of bribery and corruption

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,320
"The New Jersey senator is expected to plead not  guilty along with his wife and three businessmen.  

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,260
He's charged with helping a New Jersey halal  meat business corner the market in Egypt by  

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,720
supporting U.S. arms sales to the Egyptian  government. Prosecutors allege they found more  

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,840
than $500,000 in cash, much of it stuffed into  envelopes and hidden in the Menendezes' home.  

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,840
The senator says he's innocent and that the cash  was money he took out of the bank to have on hand  

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,140
in an emergency. Gov. Phil Murphy and Sen. Cory  Booker have called for Menendez to step down.

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,980
"For NPR News, I'm Nancy Solomon,  in Maplewood, New Jersey."

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,160
The House has voted to pass  a procedural vote that opens  

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,280
debate on some long-term spending  bills for the federal government,  

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,380
but that debate won't come fast enough to  stop a looming government shutdown late  

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,540
Saturday night. The Senate didn't wait — senators  overwhelmingly passed a short-term spending bill,  

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,280
but House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he'll  put forward his own bill in a couple of days.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,620
Israelis will soon be able to travel to  the United States without getting a visa.  

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,940
This comes after years of negotiation  and Israeli steps to make it easier  

20
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,160
for Palestinian Americans to travel to  Israel. NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports:

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,560
"In recent months, the U.S. has been monitoring  Israeli pledges to treat all U.S. citizens  

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,780
equally, including Palestinians and other  Arab Americans who have faced restrictions  

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,480
and harassment at Israeli borders. U.S. officials  point out that all Americans can now go through  

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,720
Ben Gurion Airport to enter Israel or to travel  to Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories,  

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,260
and the U.S will continue to monitor this, even as  Israel officially joins the visa waiver program.  

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,540
The U.S. is now updating its immigration  procedures for Israelis and expect that,  

27
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,280
by Nov. 30, Israelis will be able  to come to the U.S without a visa.

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,100
"Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, Washington."

29
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,180
The Writer's Guild of America's  strike against Hollywood studios  

30
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,160
is over. Union members must still vote  on whether to ratify their new contract,  

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,320
but the union leadership voted to approve the  deal. Members are allowed to return to work.  

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,120
However, the actors' union, SAG-AFTRA,  is still on strike against the Hollywood  

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,520
studios. Some members joined a picket line  outside Netflix' offices in Los Angeles:

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,893
"We're ready. The strike is not over. SAG-AFTRA...

35
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:54,069
"We are still here. We are on strike. We have  yet to receive a contract from the AMPTP."

36
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:54,780
"What he said!"

37
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:05,040
A note: SAG-AFTRA represents most of NPR's  

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,100
journalists but are governed  under a different contract.

39
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,320
