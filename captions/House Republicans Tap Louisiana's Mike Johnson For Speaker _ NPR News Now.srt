00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,560
Gaza's Health Ministry says more  than 6,500 people have been killed  

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,600
in Israeli air strikes, which continued overnight.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,880
And the House of Representatives is expected to  

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,640
vote today on Congressman Mike  Johnson's bid to be Speaker.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,160
Good morning, I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,640
The Israeli military says it carried out  more than 400 air strikes on Gaza yesterday,  

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,360
and the bombing did not stop overnight. NPR's  Peter Kenyon reports the Hamas-run Gaza Health  

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:35,080
Ministry says more than 6,500 people have been  killed there, and 2,700 of them are children:

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,160
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry says the,  "massive air bombardment" pounded Gaza overnight,  

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,960
contributing to the unprecedented death  toll since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.  

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,720
The attacks came as Gaza continues to suffer  severe shortages of food, water and medicine,  

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,960
despite the arrival of some truckloads  filled with humanitarian aid. Separately,  

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,320
the IDF said it thwarted an assault by a  group of Hamas militants who came ashore on  

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,880
an Israeli beach, just north of Gaza. Israel  responded with air, sea and ground forces.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,920
Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Jerusalem.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,760
President Biden may make comments today about  the war between Israel and Hamas militants.  

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,960
He'll also be welcoming the Prime Minister  of Australia to the White House. Australian  

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,280
leader Anthony Albanese will also be the guest  of honor tonight at a White House State Dinner.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,080
The House of Representatives is expected to  vote today to elect a Speaker. Republicans  

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,080
have nominated Louisiana Congressman Mike  Johnson. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports he's  

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,480
the fourth nominee in three weeks  the GOP hopes can get the gavel:

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,720
Johnson won the House GOP vote after multiple  ballots and just hours after another Republican,  

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,400
Tom Emmer, from Minnesota, was nominated but was  forced to withdraw because he couldn't lock down  

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,120
the votes for a full House vote. Johnson  vowed he'll get the House back to work:

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,960
We're going to serve the people of  this country — we're going to restore  

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,240
their faith in this Congress. ... You're  going to see a new form of government,  

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,280
and we are going to move this quickly.  This group here is ready to govern.

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Johnson needs the support of almost all  House Republicans. If he gets the votes,  

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,440
the new Speaker starts with immediate challenges:  He'll need to negotiate a deal to avoid a  

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,320
government shutdown next month and navigate a  large foreign aid package for Israel and Ukraine.

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
Deirdre Walsh, NPR News.

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,040
The Senate has voted 98-0 to approve President  Biden's nominee to be the chief of the Federal  

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,120
Aviation Administration. Michael Whitaker  is a former FAA Deputy Administrator.

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,000
An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot is facing  scores of federal and Oregon state charges.  

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,200
Joseph Emerson tried to cut off a jet's  engines mid-flight on Sunday. He was  

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,280
riding in the cockpit with the crew on duty,  who overpowered him before he could do it.  

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,320
Aubrey Gavello was aboard that flight too,  and she says the passengers were rattled:

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,600
No fight, no commotion, um, just nervous  passengers — but quietly nervous.

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,000
Emerson, meanwhile, faces 83 accounts  of attempted murder in Oregon. Police  

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,200
in Portland released information yesterday  about the off-duty pilot. They say Emerson  

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,240
told them he'd taken hallucinogenic  mushrooms two days before the flight.

00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,400
