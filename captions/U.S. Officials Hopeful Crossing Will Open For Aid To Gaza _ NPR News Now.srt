00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
Good morning. Today is Monday,  October 16th. I'm Korva Coleman,  

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,040
from NPR News, and here are today's top stories:

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,080
NPR's learned President Biden is delaying  a trip to Colorado that he had planned for  

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,680
today. Instead, Biden will remain  at the White House to participate  

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,840
in national security meetings as the conflict  between Israel and Hamas militants continues.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,480
There's still no word on the status of the  border crossing in southern Gaza. Secretary  

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,640
of State Antony Blinken said yesterday  that it would open to allow humanitarian  

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,880
relief aid to reach Palestinians and  to let Americans trapped in Gaza get  

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,240
out into Egypt. White House National  Security Council spokesman John Kirby:

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,280
Part of the reason was Hamas was putting up  roadblocks and refusing to let people even  

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,480
approach the gate, so, again, we're going  to work on this very, very hard — with both  

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Israel and Egypt. We want to see safe passage  for people that, that, that want to get out.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,360
He spoke to Weekend All Things Considered.  It's not clear that the crossing has yet  

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,320
opened. Secretary Blinken is back in  Israel today for meetings with leaders.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,040
The head of the World Health Organization  says Gaza is suffering from a "humanitarian  

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,120
and public health catastrophe." NPR's Ari  Daniel reports this comes amid Israel's  

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,640
continuing response to Hamas militants,  who attacked more than a week ago:

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,720
Hospitals across Gaza are overwhelmed with the  increasing number of patients needing urgent  

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,640
treatment for injuries caused by Israel's ongoing  bombardment. Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah is a plastic  

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,000
surgeon usually based in London. For the last  week, he's been at Al Awda Hospital in Gaza:

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,240
There are patients on mattresses  on the floors everywhere,  

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,480
and there are over 200 patients who  need to go to the operating room and  

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,320
and can't because more critically  ill patients are taking precedence.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Abu-Sittah says each day the hospital's tearing  through medical supplies that should last a  

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,880
month and a half. The WHO says Gaza needs  "the immediate and safe delivery of food,  

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
medical supplies and other humanitarian aid.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,960
ArI Daniel, NPR News.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,080
France is at its highest level of alert  following the fatal stabbing of a teacher  

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,520
at a high school in the north of the country.  Police say the attack was by a former student  

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,880
at the school who was described as an Islamist  radical. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports:

31
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,720
A 20-year-old Chechen has been arrested in the  school attack, and French Interior Minister  

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Gérald Darmanin suggested there could be a  link with the violence in the Middle East,  

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,320
though investigators have yet to announce a  motive. Several Paris tourist destinations  

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,680
were evacuated briefly Saturday amidst bomb  threats, and 7,000 French soldiers have  

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,280
been deployed to protect sensitive venues.  Paris' historic Jewish quarter, The Marais,  

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,880
still seemed bustling, but kosher restaurant  manager Romain Lodé says people are jittery:

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,760
Since the war start in Israel, it's  kind of bit different, you know,  

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,840
it's very quiet. People are scared to  come out. It's very hard, at the moment.

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,760
The French government has  banned all pro-Palestinian  

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,600
demonstrations for fear they could spark violence.

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News.

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Business in the House of Representatives  continues to be frozen because there's no  

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Speaker. Congressman Jim Jordan won  a GOP leadership election last week  

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,280
but appears to still be far short  of the votes he needs to win the  

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,240
speakership election. House Republicans  are expected to meet and talk later today.
