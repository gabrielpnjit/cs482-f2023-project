The Justice Department plans  to push for a speedy trial in  

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,480
former President Donald Trump's January 6th case.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,760
And the Parkland, Florida, school shooting will  be reenacted today as part of a civil lawsuit.

Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman, from NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,400
The special counsel prosecuting  former President Donald Trump has  

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,320
a week to propose a trial date in the  January 6th case. NPR's Carrie Johnson  

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,760
reports the Justice Department wants  a speedy trial in Washington D.C."

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,980
"Prosecutor Thomas Windom says this case, like  any other, should be handled in regular order,  

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,220
and that means a speedy trial. Former President  Trump pleaded not guilty to four felony charges,  

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,500
including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and  conspiracy to obstruct Congress as it certified  

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,260
ballots on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump's lawyer, John  Lauro, says there's a significant amount of  

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,540
evidence in the case to review. He suggested Trump  may seek a long-shot bid to move the case to West  

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,580
Virginia, where more people voted for Trump.  The former president is the front-runner for  

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,040
the GOP nomination in 2024. He'll be fighting  three criminal cases during the campaign.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,220
The National Weather Service says  excessive heat is sticking around  

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,100
the southwest and south-central parts of  the U.S. Temperatures up to 115 degrees  

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,980
are expected in Phoenix today. The heat index  will be almost the same today in Oklahoma City.

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,500
Heavy thunderstorms are crossing Alabama this  morning. Forecasters have issued flash flood  

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,420
warnings for some northern parts of the state.  They say as much as four inches of rain have  

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,120
already fallen and another three inches could  be on the way. Parts of the same area were hit  

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,700
by storms yesterday. Ten people were hurt  in Etowah County, Alabama, about 60 miles  

23
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,940
northeast of Birmingham. Rusty Tidmore ran to  get his daughter off his bus when the storms hit:

24
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,300
"I get to the bus to get my daughter  off the top bunk — trees falling  

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,780
everywhere — I put a dragger into floor  and I'm holding her in the floor and,  

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,120
as we hit the floor of the  bus, it lifts off the ground."

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,040
More flash flood warnings are also posted this  morning in parts of Missouri and Tennessee.

28
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,920
Today, the shooting that claimed 17 lives  at a high school in Parkland, Florida,  

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,880
five years ago is being reenacted. NPR's Kristin  Wright reports it's part of a civil lawsuit:

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,160
"Ballistics experts will fire live ammunition  from an identical weapon as the gunman from the  

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,320
same locations inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School. The community has expressed anger,  

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,180
but the court decided the reenactment might  address a key question. The school resource  

33
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,040
officer on duty that day, a sheriff's deputy,  never entered the building. Scott Peterson said  

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,420
he couldn't hear all of the shots or pinpoint  where they were coming from. University of  

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,340
Michigan law school Professor Len Niehoff  says reenactments can demonstrate complexity:

36
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,780
'One reason you sometimes admit  demonstrative evidence is to help  

37
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,860
the jury understand that they actually know  less about something than they think they do.'

38
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,560
"A judge will decide whether  a recording of the reenactment  

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,580
is played for the jury. Peterson was  acquitted of criminal charges in June.
