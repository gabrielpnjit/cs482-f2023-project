A federal judge has dismissed former  President Donald Trump's defamation

countersuit against writer E. Jean Carroll.

00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,960
And Zoom is scrapping plans to use  customer data to train its AI tools.

Good morning. I'm Nora Raum, with NPR  News, and here are today's top stories:

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,400
President Biden is on a three-state  swing through the western U.S. NPR's  

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,540
Windsor Johnston reports the president  is starting his trip today in Arizona:

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,960
"Biden is expected to announce plans for a new  national monument to preserve one million acres  

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,020
during a stop today at the Grand Canyon. From  Arizona, Biden will then head to Albuquerque,  

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,020
New Mexico, to make another pitch for his  economic agenda. On Thursday, Biden will  

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,200
travel to Salt Lake City, Utah, to mark one year  since Congress passed the bipartisan PACT Act,  

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,540
which provides benefits to U.S. service  members who were exposed to toxic substances."

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,260
A federal judge has dismissed former  President Donald Trump's defamation  

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,660
countersuit against writer E. Jean  Carroll. NPR's Jaclyn Diaz has more:

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,060
"Trump and his attorneys had claimed that the  author and former magazine writer defamed Trump  

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,600
when she said he raped her on CNN. When she said  this, Carroll was being interviewed after she won  

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,940
one of her lawsuits against Trump. The jury  in that case found Trump liable for sexually  

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,180
abusing Carroll and defaming her. In dismissing  Trump's countersuit, federal judge Lewis Kaplan  

19
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,220
said Carroll's statements repeating the claim  that Trump had raped her were substantially true.  

20
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,840
This latest development means  that an upcoming January 15th  

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,980
trial in a previous lawsuit filed by  Carroll against Trump will continue.

22

"Jaclyn Diaz, NPR News."

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,320
Executives at Zoom say the company  does not use customer data to train  

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,020
its artificial intelligence tools. As NPR's  Bobby Allen reports, the announcement comes  

25
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,780
after reports that Zoom uses what people  say on video calls to advance its AI:

26
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,560
"Tech bloggers recently discovered that  Zoom quietly updated its terms of service  

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,220
to say that Zoom reserves a right  to train its AI on customers' video,  

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,260
audio and chat transcripts without explicit  permission. After a backlash from customers,  

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,460
Zoom went on the defensive, saying in a  statement that it would not use customer  

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,200
data to improve its AI without consent. But  critics point out that Zoom has a poor track  

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,940
record on data privacy. Zoom was criticized  in 2020 after providing end-to-end encryption  

32
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,280
only to customers who paid for the service. A  year later, the company agreed to a $85 million  

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,080
settlement over sharing customer data with  Google, Facebook and LinkedIn without consent.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,060
The polls are open in Ohio in a special election.  

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,980
Voters are deciding whether to raise the  threshold for amending the State Constitution  

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,540
and to impose more stringent standards to  get an amendment on the ballot in the first  

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,840
place. Abortion rights activists oppose the  changes. In November, voters in Ohio are to  

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,880
consider a proposed constitutional amendment  to protect access to abortion in the state.
